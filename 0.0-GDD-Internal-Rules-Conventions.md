# 0.0 GDTLancer - Internal GDD Rules and Conventions

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Related Documents:** `0.1-GDD-Main.md`, `README.md`

---

## 1. Overview

This document defines the structural conventions and formatting rules used throughout the GDTLancer Game Design Documentation (GDD). Adhering to these rules ensures consistency, clarity, and facilitates the project's **transmedia goals**, particularly the eventual extraction of a standalone Analogue TTRPG ruleset.

## 2. GDD Structure & Numeration

The GDD is organized into chapters and sub-chapters using a numerical prefix system, followed by a descriptive name.

* **Format:** `X.Y-GDD-<ChapterName>-<SubChapterName>.md`
    * `X`: Represents the major chapter number (e.g., `1` for Core Mechanics, `5` for Gameplay Modules, `7` for Assets).
    * `Y`: Represents the sub-chapter or specific page number within that chapter (e.g., `7.1` for Ship Design Philosophy, `7.2` for Ship Engines).
    * `GDD`: Standard identifier.
    * `<ChapterName>`/`<SubChapterName>`: Descriptive title using PascalCase or hyphenated lowercase.

* **Example:** `5.1-GDD-Module-Piloting.md` is the first page (`.1`) in the Gameplay Modules chapter (`5`).

* **Ordering:** This system ensures files are sorted logically within the repository filesystem and provides a clear hierarchy. The `README.md` file serves as the master index.

## 3. Standard Page Structure

To support the project's goal of eventual separation into Digital (Godot) and Analogue (TTRPG) components, most GDD pages describing specific game elements (like Assets or Modules) **must** follow a standardized section structure:

1.  **Header:**
    * **Page Title:** (`# X.Y GDTLancer - Descriptive Title`)
    * **Metadata:** `Version`, `Date`, `Related Documents` (listing all directly relevant GDD pages by filename).
    * **Separator:** `---`

2.  **Section 1: Overview**
    * **Purpose:** Briefly explain the scope and purpose of the page and the element it describes.
    * **Structure Note:** Explicitly state that the document follows the standard 3-part structure (Lore/Godot/Analogue).

3.  **Section 2: Part 1: Lore & Visuals (or Description / Conceptual)**
    * **Purpose:** Contains all player-facing descriptive text, lore justifications, visual descriptions, and aesthetic notes.
    * **Content:** This section should align with the game's established lore and art style. Use tables for comparisons where appropriate.

4.  **Section 3: Part 2: Godot Implementation (or Digital Implementation)**
    * **Purpose:** Details the specific implementation within the Godot Engine (v3.x).
    * **Content:** Defines `Resource` properties, `AgentTemplate` stats, system interactions, specific GDScript function requirements, data structures, and concrete gameplay values used by the digital version. Should reference relevant code files or architectural patterns.

5.  **Section 4: Part 3: Analogue Implementation**
    * **Purpose:** Describes how the element is represented and functions within the tabletop RPG ruleset.
    * **Content:** Defines abstracted stats, `Asset Difficulty` modifiers, special rules, interactions with core TTRPG mechanics like `Action Checks`, `TU`, `WP`, `FP`, and provides formatting guidance for physical components.

* **Note:** Pages defining high-level concepts (like `0.1-GDD-Main.md`) or purely organizational documents (like this one) may omit the strict Part 1/2/3 structure where it doesn't apply.

---

## 4. Rationale for Structure

This strict separation serves a critical long-term goal:

* **TTRPG Extraction:** Once the Godot project is sufficiently mature, the "Part 2: Godot Implementation" sections can be programmatically or manually removed from the GDD.
* **Result:** The remaining content (Overview, Lore/Visuals, Analogue Implementation) forms the basis of a cohesive and functional rulebook and lore guide for the standalone GDTLancer Analogue TTRPG. This structure minimizes the effort required for this transmedia adaptation.

---

## 5. Citations

* **Requirement:** All GDD pages must use the `` format to cross-reference information from other GDD pages. This ensures traceability and helps maintain consistency.
