## 0. Introduction

* **Game Title:** GDTLancer (Working Title)
* **Logline:** A multi-platform space adventure RPG where player and AI actions shape a living world. Blends sandbox simulation with narrative mechanics.
* **Genre:** 3D Space Adventure, RPG, Sandbox, Simulation.
* **Theme:** Emergent stories from a simulated world; pragmatic, function-first sci-fi. Focus on managing risk, time, and resources.
* **Target Audience:** Fans of Space Sims (Elite, Freelancer), Sandbox RPGs (Mount & Blade), and Narrative TTRPGs (Stars Without Number, Ironsworn).
* **Platforms:**
    * Primary Digital: PC (Godot 3).
    * Secondary Digital: Mobile (J2ME-style).
    * Analogue: Standalone TTRPG ruleset.
* **Unique Selling Points:**
    * Emergent stories driven by agent actions.
    * A living world that evolves over time.
    * Play on PC, mobile, or as a tabletop RPG.
    * Unique low-poly 3D art style.
    * Uncover world history through gameplay.

## 1. Glossary

* **Action Approach:** Player's stance (`Act Risky` or `Act Cautiously`) that influences an action's outcome.
* **Action Check:** The core dice roll: `3d6 + Modifier`.
* **Agent:** An active entity pursuing goals (Player or NPC).
* **Asset:** A significant non-consumable item (ship, module, gear).
* **Asset Progression:** A meta-progression system where players invest resources (WP, TU) and complete objectives to acquire new assets.
* **Chronicle:** The system that logs major world events and actions.
* **Contact:** An abstract NPC the player interacts with via menus to gain missions, information, and build relationships.
* **Faction:** A distinct political or corporate entity in the game world with which the player can gain or lose standing.
* **Focus Points (FP):** A resource spent to improve an Action Check result.
* **G-Stasis Cradle:** In-lore tech that allows pilots to survive high-G maneuvers.
* **Goal System:** System for tracking Agent objectives.
* **Lancer Doctrine:** The cultural doctrine of non-destructive ship combat, born from scarcity of materials and personnel.
* **Module:** A set of mechanics for a specific activity (e.g., Combat, Mining).
* **Pragmatic Aesthetics:** Function-first ship design philosophy.
* **Reputation:** A narrative stat tracking the player's professional standing (e.g., "Dependable," "Opportunist").
* **Ship Quirk:** A negative trait an asset can acquire due to damage or failed actions, often imposing a mechanical penalty.
* **Time Clock:** Tracks time. When full, it triggers a World Event Tick.
* **Time Unit (TU):** An abstract unit of time. Actions cost TUs.
* **Wealth Points (WP):** Abstract resource for major purchases, representing an agent's economic power.
* **World Event Tick:** Triggered by the Time Clock; advances the world simulation state.
* **World State:** All data representing the current status of the game world.

## 2. Game Pillars

* **Living World:** The world evolves based on the actions of all agents and the passage of time.
* **Emergent Narrative:** Stories emerge naturally from the simulation and player choices.
* **Meaningful Progression:** Progress by improving skills, completing goals, acquiring assets, and building wealth.
* **Simple, Consistent Rules:** Core mechanics are unified and easy to learn.
* **Player Driven:** Players direct the experience by managing risks, time, and resources.

## 3. Core Gameplay Design

* **3.1. Philosophy:** A simulation-first design. Players interact with game modules (e.g., Piloting, Combat) and make meaningful choices about risk and resource management.
* **3.2. Gameplay Modules:** Game activities, such as:
    * Piloting & Travel
    * Combat (Ship)
    * Trading
    * Interaction (Social)
    * Mining & Repair
    * Investigation & Exploration
* **3.3. Core Loop:** Players use modules for activities. Key actions require a check, influenced by the player's chosen risk level (`Risky` / `Cautious`). The outcome affects the world and the player's resources (FP, WP, TU).

## 4. Development Framework

* **4.1. Structure:** Development is organized by Layers (complexity), Modules (activities), and Systems (cross-cutting rules).
* **4.2. Development Layers:**
    * **Layer 1 (Core):** Basic module function and core mechanics.
    * **Layer 2 (Narrative):** Goal/Event systems and narrative outcomes.
    * **Layer 3 (Simulation):** NPC agent simulation and world evolution.
    * **Layer 4 (Legacy):** Faction mechanics and long-term consequences.
* **4.3. Phased Plan:**
    * **Phase 1 (Core Loop):** Establish a playable "vertical slice" of the game. Includes basic Piloting, Combat, and Trading modules and their supporting systems.
    * **Phase 2 (Narrative):** Add Mining/Repair; integrate Layer 2 systems.
    * **Phase 3 (Living World):** Add Investigation; begin Layer 3 simulation.

## 5. Art & Audio

* **Visuals:** "Neo-Retro 3D" - low-poly, hard-edged models with modern lighting, inspired by early 3D graphics.
* **Audio:** Minimalist, functional sound effects and atmospheric music that supports the tone of pragmatic space travel.
* **UI/UX:** A clean, non-intrusive UI that clearly communicates game state and choices. Easy to learn but provides depth for experienced players.

## 6. Technical

* **Engine:** Godot 3 (Primary), with a parallel J2ME-style version for mobile.
* **Analogue:** A parallel tabletop RPG design using the same core mechanics.
* **Modularity:** A modular architecture to ensure systems are independent and maintainable.
