## 1. Purpose

This document defines the game's core rules for resolving actions and managing key resources. These mechanics are used across all gameplay modules.

## 2. Action Check

Used for any action where the outcome is uncertain.

* **Core Mechanic:** `3d6 + Module Modifier`
* **Module Modifier:** `Relevant Skill + Asset Modifier +/- Situational Modifiers`
* **Thresholds:** The roll's total determines the quality of the outcome.
    * **Critical Success (14+):** The action succeeds exceptionally well, providing a bonus.
    * **Success (10-13):** The action succeeds as intended.
    * **Failure (<10):** The action fails, often with a complication.

## 3. Action Approach

A choice the player makes *before* rolling to influence the nature of the outcome.

* **Act Cautiously:** Prioritizes safety. A failure is less severe (e.g., lost time instead of damage), but a success offers no special bonus.
* **Act Risky:** Aims for a greater reward. A success is more effective or profitable, but a failure is more severe (e.g., critical damage instead of minor trouble).

## 4. Core Resources

These are the primary abstract resources players manage throughout the game.

### 4.1. Focus Points (FP)

* **What it is:** Represents an agent's mental energy, luck, or willpower.
* **How it works:** Spend FP *before* an Action Check to add a +1 bonus to the roll per point spent.
* **How to gain:** Earned by completing goals, roleplaying well, or through specific actions and outcomes.

### 4.2. Wealth Points (WP)

* **What it is:** An abstract resource representing significant economic power. It is not granular cash, but a measure of major purchasing power.
* **How it works:** Used to buy ships and modules, pay for major repairs, and cover the periodic Upkeep cost.
* **How to gain:** Earned from completing jobs, selling valuable assets (salvage, data), and achieving major goals.

### 4.3. Time Units (TU)

* **What it is:** An abstract measure of time. Most significant actions, like traveling, repairing, or undertaking a mission, cost TUs.
* **How it works:** Spending TU advances the **Time Clock**. When the clock fills, a **World Event Tick** occurs, advancing the world simulation.
* **Significance:** Time is a critical resource. The world changes and evolves independently of the player. Spending time on one opportunity means others may be lost.
