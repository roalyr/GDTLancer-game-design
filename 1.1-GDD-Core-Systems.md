# GDTLancer - Core Systems (Phase 1)

**Version:** 1.3
**Date:** August 4, 2025
**Related Documents:** 0.1-GDD-Main.md (v1.8), 5.1-GDD-Module-Piloting.md (v1.6), 5.2-GDD-Module-Combat.md (v1.4), 5.3-GDD-Module-Trading.md (v1.1)

## 1. Overview

This document defines the core, cross-cutting gameplay systems required to support the Phase 1 modules (Piloting, Combat, Trading). The definitions and terminology herein are designed to align with the existing project codebase to ensure consistency between design and implementation. All systems listed are located within the `/core/systems/` directory.

*Note: The `EventBus` is an autoload script (`/core/event_bus.gd`) used for managing engine-level signals. It is a core piece of the architecture but is not a gameplay system in the same vein as those listed below.*

## 2. System Definitions

### System 1: Event System
* **Code Reference:** `core/systems/event_system.gd`
* **Core Responsibility:** To act as a narrative and world event "oracle." It generates and triggers in-game events based on the passage of Time Units (TU), player actions, and other dynamic world states. These are high-level gameplay events (e.g., an ambush, a market opportunity, a distress call), not to be confused with low-level engine signals handled by the `EventBus`.

### System 2: Time System
* **Code Reference:** `core/systems/time_system/time_system.gd`
* **Core Responsibility:** To manage the passage of abstract game time (`Time Units` or `TU`) and its consequences.
* **Phase 1 Functionality:**
    * Must maintain a global `Time Clock` variable that tracks the current number of `TU`s.
    * Must provide a function to add `TU` to the `Time Clock`.
    * When the `Time Clock` reaches its maximum value, it must:
        1.  Emit a `world_event_tick_triggered` signal on the `EventBus`.
        2.  Call the `Character System` to deduct the periodic `WP` Upkeep cost.
        3.  Reset the `Time Clock` to zero.
* **Interactions:**
    * **Interacts With:**
        * `Piloting Module`: Free Flight mode will call the function to add `TU`.
        * `Trading Module`: Actions like `Seek Rare Goods` will add `TU`.
        * `Character System`: To apply the `WP` Upkeep cost.
        * `EventBus`: To announce the `World Event Tick`.

### System 3: Character System
* **Code Reference:** `core/systems/character_system/character_system.gd`
* **Core Responsibility:** To track and manage the core narrative stats, skills, and social standing for the player agent.
* **Phase 1 Functionality:**
    * Must track the player's current **Wealth Points (WP)** and **Focus Points (FP)**.
    * Must provide functions to safely add or subtract `WP` and `FP`.
    * Must contain the player's skill values: `Piloting Skill`, `Tactics Skill`, `Trading Skill`.
    * Must manage the data for narrative stubs, including the player's overall `Reputation` and their `Faction Standing` with various groups.
    * Must have a function to handle the `Upkeep Cost` deduction when called by the `Time System`.
* **Interactions:**
    * **Interacts With:**
        * `Trading Module`: To modify the player's `WP` total.
        * `Combat/Piloting Modules`: To retrieve skill values for calculating `Module Modifiers`.
        * `Time System`: Receives the call to deduct `WP` for upkeep.
        * `GameStateManager`: Provides player stat data for saving and loading.

### System 4: Inventory System
* **Code Reference:** `core/systems/inventory_system/inventory_system.gd`
* **Core Responsibility:** To manage the contents of an agent's cargo hold.
* **Phase 1 Functionality:**
    * Must define a basic data structure for a commodity (e.g., a `Resource` with properties for ID, name, base value).
    * Must maintain a list or dictionary of commodities currently held by the player.
    * Must provide functions to `addItem(item, quantity)` and `removeItem(item, quantity)`.
    * All inventory modifications must respect the `Cargo Capacity` stat of the player's ship.
* **Interactions:**
    * **Interacts With:**
        * `Trading Module`: The Trade Interface will call this system's functions to modify the player's inventory during transactions.
        * `Asset System`: To retrieve the player ship's `Cargo Capacity`.

### System 5: Asset System
* **Code Reference:** `core/systems/asset_system/asset_system.gd`
* **Core Responsibility:** To track and manage an agent's major, non-consumable assets (specifically the ship in Phase 1) and their associated stats and conditions.
* **Phase 1 Functionality:**
    * Must define a basic data structure for a Ship Asset (e.g., a `Resource`) that contains all relevant stats.
    * Must maintain a reference to the player's currently active ship asset.
    * Must provide getter functions for other systems to query the current ship's stats (e.g., `get_player_ship_stat("CargoCapacity")`).
    * Must manage the data for the **Ship Quirks** narrative stub, including a list of active quirks on the player's ship.
* **Interactions:**
    * **Interacts With:**
        * `Inventory System`: Provides the `Cargo Capacity` stat.
        * `Combat Module`: Provides stats like `Hull Integrity`, `Shields`, and `Weapon Systems`.
        * `Piloting Module`: Provides stats like `Mass`, `Agility`, and `Thruster Power`.
