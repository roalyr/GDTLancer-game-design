## 1. Overview

This document lists key development challenges for GDTLancer to help with planning and risk management. Identifying these issues early allows for proactive problem-solving.

## 2. Core Design Challenges

### Challenge: Emergent Narrative Complexity
The goal of a 'living world' with emergent stories is difficult. The main challenge is making sure the stories are coherent and engaging, not random and repetitive.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Phased Rollout:** Introduce agent complexity and simulation depth gradually over several development phases.
    * **Clear NPC Logic:** Give NPCs clear goal-selection rules (heuristics) to guide their behavior toward believable actions.
    * **Use the Chronicle:** The Chronicle system will log major events, allowing agents to react to them and create a more connected narrative.

### Challenge: Balancing Agency and Simulation
The game needs to let players feel impactful without allowing them to easily break or exploit the world simulation.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Abstracted Resources:** Using abstract systems like Wealth Points (WP) and Time Units (TU) provides a layer of economic balancing.
    * **Soft Gates:** Guide players with narrative and economic challenges (e.g., needing a specific ship part for Asset Progression, high upkeep costs) rather than restrictive invisible walls.

## 3. Mechanical Challenges

### Challenge: Meaningful Risky/Cautious Outcomes
The `Act Risky` / `Act Cautiously` mechanic needs many unique and interesting outcomes to be effective. This is a large content creation task.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Systemic Outcomes:** Focus on outcomes that affect game systems (e.g., damaging a component and adding a Ship Quirk, gaining a contact, alerting a faction) instead of just static text results.
    * **Templated Outcomes:** Create templates for outcomes that can be easily adapted to different situations.

## 4. Technical Challenges

### Challenge: Simulation Performance
Simulating many agents, each with individual goals and states, is CPU-intensive and must be carefully managed.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **AI Level of Detail (LOD):** Agents far from the player will use a simplified simulation loop, reducing computational load.
    * **Process in Ticks:** Process major, non-urgent simulation changes during 'World Event Ticks' rather than in real-time.

### Challenge: Transmedia Consistency
Keeping the PC, mobile, and tabletop versions consistent requires significant design discipline and maintenance effort.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Single Source of Truth:** The GDDs will serve as the master design source for all versions of the game.
    * **Focus on the Core Experience:** Each version should capture the core gameplay loop and feel, even if specific features differ. The mobile version will naturally be the most simplified.
