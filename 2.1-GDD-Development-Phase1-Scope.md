## 1. Phase 1 Vision: "The First Contract" Demo

The singular goal of Phase 1 is to produce a playable, high-quality "vertical slice" of GDTLancer. This demo must establish the game's core identity by showcasing the unique blend of skill-based simulation and consequential, TTRPG-style narrative mechanics.

This initial build will focus on creating a complete and compelling, if small, player experience. It must prove that the core gameplay loops are engaging and that the foundation for the game's deeper, emergent narrative systems is sound. This version serves as the game's debut and must feel cohesive and purposeful.

## 2. Core Player Experience

In the Phase 1 demo, the player will:
* Start the game with a standard, pre-owned ship and a small amount of starting capital (WP).
* Engage with a small cast of named **Contacts** at stations to acquire contracts, building their **Relationship** score with them.
* Take on contracts from different **Factions**, which will affect their **Faction Standing**.
* Execute contracts by using the **Trading Module** to buy and sell a limited variety of commodities.
* Fly their ship in a `Free Flight` mode using the **Piloting Module**, spending **Time Units (TU)** and paying periodic `Upkeep` costs.
* Potentially face hostile NPCs in skill-based **Combat Challenges**, where victory or defeat has consequences.
* Resolve key moments—finalizing a trade, escaping a battle, docking at a station—by making **Narrative Actions** whose outcomes can grant rewards, affect their **Reputation**, or even add negative **Ship Quirks** to their vessel.
* Use their earned WP to invest in the **Asset Progression** system, working towards the tangible, long-term goal of acquiring a new, more capable ship that may unlock new gameplay opportunities.

## 3. Scope of Work: Included Components

### Modules
* **Piloting Module (v1.6):** The complete three-mode system for flight.
* **Combat Module (v1.4):** The core combat loop with hull-only targeting.
* **Trading Module (v1.1):** The core economic loop with static markets.

### Core Systems
* Event System
* Time System
* Character System
* Inventory System
* Asset System

*Note: The `Core Mechanics API` (`/core/mechanics/dice_roller.gd`) is a foundational utility for dice rolls but is not considered a "system" in the same architectural sense as the items listed above.*

### Narrative Stubs (Phase 1 Implementation)
* **Chronicle Stub ("Sector Stats"):** Tracks and displays the player's statistical impact on the game world.
* **Contact System:** Manages the player's relationships with a small cast of abstract NPCs.
* **Reputation Ledger:** A single stat tracking the player's professional standing.
* **Faction Standing:** A simple system tracking the player's standing with two distinct factions.
* **Ship Quirks:** A system for adding negative traits to a ship based on gameplay events.

## 4. Minimal Content Asset Checklist

* **Scenes:**
    * A functional **Main Menu** scene with "New Game" and "Quit" options.
    * A main **Game Scene** that hosts all managers, the player, the world, and the UI.
    * One playable **Zone Scene** containing at least two distinct station locations for trade.
* **Assets & Content:**
    * **Player Ships:** The starting ship and one additional, unlockable ship via the Asset Progression system.
    * **NPC Ship:** One hostile ship type for combat encounters.
    * **Commodities:** 3-5 unique commodity types.
    * **UI:** A functional Main HUD and menu-based interfaces for Trade, Contracts, Hangar/Asset Progression, and Contact/Faction info.
    * **Narrative:** 2-3 named Contacts and 2 named Factions for the player to interact with.
