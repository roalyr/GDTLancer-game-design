## 1. Overview & Philosophy

This document outlines the guiding principles for the functional and aesthetic design of all spaceships within the GDTLancer universe. The core philosophy is **"Pragmatic Aesthetics,"** a concept that balances the in-game lore of resource scarcity with the meta-game need for recognizable and engaging ship designs.

Designs are rooted in the "humble but ultra-reliable" original technology of The Pillar and must feel like plausible evolutions of that foundation. Visually, this is expressed through the game's "Neo-Retro 3D" style, which favors hard edges, clear silhouettes, and functional form. Mechanically, all ships are considered a primary form of `Asset` managed by the `Asset System`.

## 2. Core Functional Necessities

While the mechanical representation may be abstracted, every ship design must logically account for the following core functional components. These elements inform the visual language of the ship, ensuring that even stylized designs feel grounded and purposeful.

* **Centralized Control Hub:** A bridge or cockpit for command and control.
* **Propulsion Systems:** Engines and thrusters to enable movement.
* **Power Source:** A reactor or core to energize all ship systems.
* **Life Support:** Systems for air, temperature regulation, and radiation shielding.
* **Structural Integrity:** A hull and frame designed to withstand the stresses of space travel and combat.

## 3. Enduring Genre Conventions (GDTLancer Adaptation)

GDTLancer adapts established sci-fi conventions to fit its unique universe and gameplay goals:

* **Visual Class Archetypes:** Ships should be instantly recognizable. Fighters are small and agile, Freighters are bulky and functional, and Capital Ships are massive and imposing. These archetypes provide clear visual cues to the player about a ship's likely role and capabilities.
* **The "Rule of Cool" within Constraints:** Aesthetics and the "awesome factor" are highly valued, but must be justified within the lore. A design can be striking, but it should not feel frivolous. Every element should have a perceived function, reflecting the pragmatic, utilitarian culture of the Voyagers.
* **Modularity & Customization:** Ships are designed as modular platforms. Players will be able to modify and swap out core components like weapons, engines, and specialized equipment. This is a primary function of the `Asset System` and a key part of player progression.
* **Dramatic Sense of Scale:** The visual and mechanical difference between a small survey ship and a massive void habitat is a core part of the game's environmental design. Camera work and UI will be designed to emphasize these differences.

## 4. The "Lancer" Paradigm (Melee-Centric Design)

A defining characteristic of the Opulence system's technology and combat doctrine is its focus on close-range and melee-style engagements.

* **Justification (Matter Scarcity):** Raw matter is the primary scarce resource in the Opulence system. As a result, single-use projectile weapons that expend precious materials are seen as incredibly wasteful. They are maintained primarily for defense against unknown external threats or for "hunting" spaceborne life, not for regularized combat.
* **Doctrine:** To minimize the loss of life and matter, ritualized combat is favored over destructive warfare. This has led to the common practice of adapting industrial tools for dual-purpose use in combat. This design approach is central to the game, with examples including:
    * **Industrial Cutting Lance:** A salvage cutter that can be used as a close-range thermal spear.
    * **Tractor/Grapple System:** A cargo tow-line that can latch onto and control enemy ships.
    * **Kinetic Anchor Drill:** A mining anchor that can be fired as a kinetic projectile.
    * **Plasma Jet Cutter:** A repair welder that can be used as a short-range plasma torch.
* **Nomenclature:** This focus on mounted, melee-style weapons gives rise to the "Lancer" moniker in the game's title and is a key part of the universe's identity.

## 5. Ship Classification (Initial Outline)

All vessels are classified by their general size and intended role. The detailed stats and capabilities for each ship will be defined in the `Asset System GDD`.

* **Small Craft:** One- or two-person vessels designed for specific, short-range tasks.
    * *Examples: Fighter, Interceptor, Survey Vessel, Shuttle.*
* **Medium Craft:** Multi-crew vessels forming the backbone of most independent operations.
    * *Examples: Freighter, "Lanceship" (dedicated melee combat vessel), Cutter, Prospector.*
* **Large Craft:** Significant assets requiring large crews and substantial resources to operate.
    * *Examples: Capital Ship, Mobile Refinery, Void Habitat.*
* **Unique:** A singular classification for one-of-a-kind vessels of immense scale or historical importance.
    * *Example: The Pillar.*
