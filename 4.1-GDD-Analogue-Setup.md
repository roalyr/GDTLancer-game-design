# GDTLancer Analogue Version Setup

**Version:** 1.4
**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Related Documents:** 0.1-GDD-Main.md (v1.9), 1-GDD-Core-Mechanics.md (v1.6)

## 1. Overview & Philosophy

This document outlines the standard physical components and recommended setup for playing the Analogue (Tabletop RPG) version of GDTLancer. The goal is to deliver the core GDTLancer experience – balancing simulation abstraction with narrative mechanics, player agency, and emergent storytelling – using tabletop materials.

The Analogue version relies on narrative resolution mechanics (`Action Checks`, `Event System`) and abstract resource management (**Time Clock**, **WP**) rather than detailed simulation. Gameplay typically proceeds in turns or abstract time intervals.

## 2. Required Components

A typical solo or group session requires the following physical components per player or shared:

1.  **Dice:** At least three standard six-sided dice (3d6).
2.  **Character Sheet(s):** One per player character.
3.  **Map Sheet(s):** Represents the known space environment.
4.  **Asset/Module Sheet(s):** Representing key owned Assets (ships, major equipment).
5.  **Universal Mechanics Reference:** A concise rules summary sheet.
6.  **Module Event Booklet(s)/Reference(s):** Detailed outcome tables for specific Gameplay Modules.
7.  **Tokens/Trackers:** For managing variable values like Focus Points, Wealth Points, the Time Clock, Hull/Shield integrity, etc.

## 3. Component Details & Organization

* **3.1. Map Sheet(s):**
    * **Purpose:** Provides spatial context for navigation, exploration, and world state.
    * **Content:** Systems, points of interest, routes (with segment costs in **Time Units (TU)**, descriptors), hazards. Space for player annotations.
    * **Format:** Pre-generated maps, pointcrawls, or hex grids.

* **3.2. Character Sheet:**
    * **Purpose:** Tracks core Agent identity, capabilities, narrative state, and key meta-resources.
    * **Content:** Name, Description, Base Skills (for calculating Module Modifiers), Current/Max **Focus Points (FP)**, Current **Wealth Points (WP)**, **Time Clock** (e.g., 8 segments for tracking TU), XP/Progression track, Active Goals list, inventory/cargo summary, status effects.

* **3.3. Asset/Module Sheet(s):**
    * **Purpose:** Represents owned Assets and provides context for enabled Gameplay Modules.
    * **Format:** Double-sided sheet/card per major Asset or small booklet.
    * **Content:**
        * **Asset Side:** Asset Name, Description/Image, Key Stats (e.g., Hull Max, Shield Max, Cargo Capacity), `Asset Difficulty` scores, Enabled Modules list, Asset condition track.
        * **Module Side(s):** For each enabled Module: Module Name, Relevant Skill reference, Calculated **Module Modifier** space (`Skill + Asset Difficulty = ___`), **Integrated Outcome Table** (Summary + Event Ref Code for Risky/Cautious), Asset Variations, Module-Specific Resource Tracks (if any).

* **3.4. Universal Mechanics Reference:**
    * **Purpose:** Quick rules lookup.
    * **Content:** Action Check summary (3d6+Mod vs 10/14), Focus Point rules, Action Approach definitions (`Risky`/`Cautious`), basic Time Clock/World Event Tick overview, basic WP usage overview.

* **3.5. Module Event Booklet(s)/Reference(s):**
    * **Purpose:** Provides detailed outcomes for Event Reference Codes from Asset/Module sheets.
    * **Structure:** Organized by Module, indexed by Event Ref Code (e.g., `C-SWC-PILOT`).
    * **Content:** Descriptions, mechanical effects (stat changes, WP costs/rewards, **TU additions for delays**, new checks required, module switches, status effects), d6 sub-tables.

* **3.6. Tokens/Trackers:**
    * **Purpose:** Physical representation for fluctuating values.
    * **Examples:** Tokens/dice for Focus Points, Wealth Points, Hull/Shield points; a marker for the **Time Clock**; markers for Progress Tracks and map position.

## 4. Gameplay Flow Summary

1.  **Consult Map & Character Sheet:** Determine location, goals, resources (FP, WP), Time Clock status.
2.  **Choose Action & Engage Module:** Decide action (e.g., Travel). Select relevant **Asset/Module Sheet**. Note **Module Modifier**.
3.  **Declare Action & Approach:** State action (e.g., `Undertake Journey` segment) & declare `Act Risky` or `Act Cautiously`.
4.  **Make Action Check:** Roll 3d6 + Mod + FP bonus. Compare to Thresholds.
5.  **Find Outcome:** Use **Integrated Outcome Table** on **Asset/Module Sheet**. Note summary & **Event Reference Code**.
6.  **Resolve Outcome:** Look up Code in **Module Event Booklet**. Apply effects: update Character Sheet (**FP**, **WP**, Goals, status), **advance Time Clock (+TU)**, potentially trigger new checks or module transitions.
7.  **Check Time Clock:** If Time Clock fills, resolve **World Event Tick** (See Section 5).
8.  **Update State:** Mark map position, etc. Repeat from Step 1/2.

## 5. World Evolution ("World Event Tick")

* Simulates dynamic world changes in the Analogue Version. Triggered when the **Time Clock** on the Character Sheet fills.
* **Resolution:** Typically involves consulting Event System tables/procedures for background events AND requiring the player to pay an **Upkeep Cost in WP** representing abstract operational expenses (fuel, supplies, maintenance) accrued over that time period. Failure to pay Upkeep has consequences. The Time Clock then resets.
