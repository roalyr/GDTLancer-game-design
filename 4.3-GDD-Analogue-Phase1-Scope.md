**Date:** August 1, 2025
**Related Documents:** 0.1-GDD-Main.md (v1.8), 1-GDD-Core-Mechanics.md (v1.5), 1.1-GDD-Core-Systems.md (v1.2), 4.1-GDD-Analogue-Setup.md (v1.3), 4.2-GDD-Analogue-Setup-Formatting.md (v1.2)

## 1. Phase 1 Vision: "The First Contract" Quickstart PDF

The primary goal for the analogue version in Phase 1 is to produce a complete, playable, and publishable **"Quickstart"** or **"Starter Set"** in PDF format. This product will serve as a self-contained introduction to the GDTLancer tabletop experience for solo or group play.

This document will teach the core rules and allow players to experience the fundamental gameplay loop of taking contracts, traveling through space, resolving encounters, and managing resources. It will establish the core feeling of the game on paper and serve as the foundation for all future analogue expansions.

## 2. Core Player Experience (Analogue)

In a typical session of the Phase 1 Quickstart, the player(s) will:
* Start with a pre-generated **Character Sheet** and the starting **Ship Asset Sheet**.
* Consult the **Scenario Booklet** to choose a contract and identify their starting location on the Sector Map.
* Spend **Time Units (TU)** to travel between locations, marking their progress on the **Time Clock** track.
* Potentially roll on an **Encounter Table** during travel, which may lead to a combat scene or another narrative dilemma.
* Resolve all uncertain situations using the core **Action Check** mechanic.
* Interact with named **Contacts** described in the booklet, making choices that affect their **Relationship** score.
* Complete contracts for different **Factions**, altering their **Faction Standing**.
* See their **Reputation** change based on the outcomes and approaches of their Narrative Actions.
* Risk having negative **Ship Quirks** added to their ship sheet on a failed check.
* Track the changing state of the sector via the **Sector Stats** tracker.
* Manage their **Wealth Points (WP)**, balancing contract rewards against the periodic `Upkeep Cost` triggered by the Time Clock.

## 3. Scope of Work: Required PDF Components

The final PDF product must contain the following printable materials:

* **Quickstart Rulebook:** A short booklet explaining the core rules: Action Checks, Action Approaches, FP, WP, TU, the Time Clock, and the phased gameplay loop.
* **Printable Character Sheet:** A sheet with fields for skills, FP, WP, and tracks for the Time Clock, Reputation, and Faction Standing.
* **Printable Ship Asset Sheet:** A sheet for the starting ship, detailing its stats and providing a dedicated space to write in `Ship Quirks`.
* **Introductory Scenario Booklet:** The main content piece, containing:
    * A starter **Sector Map** with 2-3 locations.
    * A list of 3-5 introductory contracts.
    * A travel encounter table.
    * A list of 2-3 **Contacts** with space to track relationship scores.
    * A tracker for the **Sector Stats** (Chronicle Stub).
    * All necessary **Outcome Tables** for the Phase 1 Narrative Actions.
    * Stat blocks for 1-2 types of hostile NPC ships.
* **Universal Reference Sheet:** A one-page summary of rules and Action Check outcomes.

## 4. Minimal Content Requirements

* **Rules:** The final, concise text for all core mechanics.
* **Sheets:** One pre-generated character and one starting ship must be fully statted out.
* **Narrative Content:** All contracts, encounter table entries, location descriptions, Contact bios, and—most importantly—the detailed outcome text for all Narrative Actions must be written.
