## 1. Overview

This document defines the mechanics for ship-to-ship conflict, adhering to the **Preservation Convention**. Combat, as a module, prioritizes **disabling and capturing vessels** over outright destruction, reflecting the cultural and economic value placed on preserving assets. The module structures encounters into a distinct skill-based **Combat Challenge** followed by a narrative resolution via **Narrative Actions**.

**Key Design Constraint:** There are **no energy shields**. Combat focuses on overcoming hull integrity and disabling systems using specialized **Utility Tools**.

---

## 2. Development Phase 1 Focus

This design is scoped for **Phase 1 (Core Loop)**. The focus is on establishing the fundamental mechanics: targeting the main hull, applying damage using Phase 1 tools, and clear victory/disable conditions. Advanced features like specific sub-system targeting are planned for later phases.

## 3. Mode 1: Combat Challenge

This mode represents the direct, real-time engagement between vessels. It is a self-contained test of the player's combat and piloting skill.

* **Purpose:** To provide pure, skill-based ship-to-ship fighting focused on disabling tactics.
* **Mechanics:**
    * **Trigger:** Initiated by an event from Free Flight (e.g., ambush) or by accepting a mission that requires combat.
    * **Core Gameplay:** Players have direct control over their ship's movement and equipped **Utility Tools**. The core gameplay loop involves maneuvering, aiming, and using tools (like Ablative Lasers or Rotary Drills) to disable the enemy. This includes high-thrust industrial actions, such as using grapples to hold a target or drills to breach a hull, enabled by the **G-Stasis Cradle**.
    * **Targeting:** For Phase 1, targeting is limited to the enemy ship's main hull.
    * **Objective:** The challenge is successfully completed when all designated hostile targets are **neutralized** (Hull Integrity reaches 0 or another disable condition is met).
    * **Consequences of Damage:** Taking significant hull damage during the challenge, even if victorious, can result in a new "Ship Quirk" being added to the player's vessel.
    * **Pure Skill:** Success in this mode is determined solely by player performance. There are **no** `Action Checks` during the Combat Challenge.

## 4. Mode 2: Narrative Action

This is the resolution step that occurs after the Combat Challenge is successfully completed (i.e., the enemy is neutralized). It determines the consequences and potential rewards of the engagement.

* **Purpose:** To resolve the strategic and narrative fallout of a battle, emphasizing the **Preservation Convention's** goals.
* **Mechanics:**
    * **Trigger:** Player-initiated command selected from a menu after the last enemy ship is neutralized.
    * **Core Mechanic:** Utilizes the standard `3d6 + Module Modifier` **Action Check** to determine the outcome.
    * **Consequences:** Outcomes directly modify narrative stubs like "Reputation," "Faction Standing," and sector "World Stats". Successful disablement/capture should yield better rewards than simple destruction.
    * **Essential Phase 1 Actions:**
        * **Assess the Aftermath:** A general-purpose action to evaluate the battlefield context. Success might reveal faction affiliations or recoverable intel. Failure might mean misidentifying the wreck or attracting unwanted attention.
        * **Claim Wreckage:** A specific attempt to salvage components from a **disabled** ship. Success yields a valuable asset or adds to `WP`. A `Risky` approach might yield more `WP` but damage `Repation` ("Opportunist"). Failure could mean the wreckage is too unstable.

## 5. Required Phase 1 Systems & Stats

* **Required Agent Stats (from Character System):**
    * `Tactics Skill`: The base value used to calculate the `Module Modifier` for combat-related Narrative Actions.
* **Required Ship Stats (from Asset System):**
    * `Hull Integrity`: The ship's health points.
    * Equipped **`Utility Tools`**: These define the ship's offensive capabilities (damage output, range, special effects like grappling).
* **Core System Integration:**
    * **Event System:** To initiate combat encounters.
    * **Time System:** Combat Challenges and subsequent actions consume **Time Units (TU)**.
    * **Core Mechanics API:** To resolve Narrative Actions.
    * **Asset System:** Provides the ship's `Hull Integrity` and tracks equipped `Utility Tools`.
    * **Character System:** Provides the `Tactics Skill` for Narrative Action checks.
