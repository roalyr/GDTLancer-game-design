## 1. Purpose & Scope

* **Module Name:** Combat
* **Purpose:** Governs the resolution of ship-to-ship conflict.
* **Scope:** This module encompasses targeting, maneuvering for offensive/defensive position, and the use of ship `Assets` as weapons. It is typically initiated as a result of an `Event System` outcome during other activities, such as Piloting. The module's mechanics are heavily informed by the "Lancer" paradigm of close-range, melee-focused engagements to conserve scarce resources.

## 2. Core Loop Integration

Combat encounters adhere to the game's core resolution loop, layering narrative mechanics on top of the base simulation.

* **Trigger Actions:** Key offensive or defensive actions where the outcome is uncertain (e.g., firing a weapon, ramming, attempting to disable a subsystem) are considered `Trigger Actions`.
* **Action Check Resolution:** All `Trigger Actions` in combat are resolved using the core `Action Check` system (`3d6 + Module Modifier â‰¥ Thresholds`). The `Module Modifier` will be derived from the relevant character skill (e.g., Piloting, Gunnery) and the difficulty/quality of the `Asset` being used.
* **Action Approach:** Before making an `Action Check`, the player must declare their `Action Approach` (`Act Risky` or `Act Cautiously`). This choice determines the nature of the outcome. For example:
    * **`Act Risky` Attack:** A success might deal extra damage or inflict a critical hit. A failure might result in the player's ship being left vulnerable or taking damage.
    * **`Act Cautiously` Attack:** A success might deal standard damage. A failure might simply be a miss with no further negative consequences, or a complication might involve a significant expenditure of `Time Units (TU)` to regain position.

## 3. Dual-Purpose Asset Doctrine

Consistent with the principle of "Pragmatic Aesthetics", most combat "weapons" are dual-purpose industrial or survey tools.

* **Contextual Activation:** The function of an equipped `Asset` is determined by the player's current target. A single "Activate" input will trigger different actions based on context, which must be clearly communicated to the player via the UI.
* **Example Dual-Purpose Systems:**
    * **Kinetic Anchor Drill:** A mining anchor that can be fired as a kinetic projectile.
    * **Industrial Cutting Lance:** A salvage cutter that can be used as a close-range thermal spear.
    * **Tractor/Grapple System:** A cargo tow-line that can latch onto and control enemy ships.
    * **Hydraulic Pincer:** Salvage jaws that can physically crush enemy ship components.
    * **Plasma Jet Cutter:** A repair welder that can be used as a short-range plasma torch.
    * **Magnetic Field Collector:** A dust-gathering tool that can induce extreme heat in enemy hulls.
    * **Ablation Laser:** A survey tool that can be used to blind and destroy enemy sensors.

(Note: The specific mechanics, damage values, and `Asset Difficulty` for each item will be detailed in the `Asset System GDD`.)

## 4. Combat Maneuvering & Commands

Effective combat relies on the `Essential Ship Commands` defined within the Piloting & Travel module. Their application in combat is critical for success.

* **Core Maneuvers:**
    * `Match Velocity`: Essential for closing to and maintaining the effective range of close-quarters weapons.
    * `Maintain Relative Position`: Used to stay in a target's blind spot or maintain a specific engagement angle.
    * `Strafe Around Target`: Allows a ship to keep its primary weapons facing an enemy while dodging laterally.
* **Reactive Behaviors:**
    * `Apply Impulse`: A "fake physics" function that simulates a sudden push or rotation when a ship is hit by a kinetic impact, potentially interrupting the target's actions.

## 5. UI/UX Considerations for Combat

Clarity is paramount for the combat interface. The player must understand their options and the potential consequences of their actions.

* **Contextual Targeting Reticle:** The HUD must dynamically update the targeting reticle to reflect the contextual action available for the equipped `Asset`. For example, the reticle should display a "LANCE" prompt over an enemy ship but a "MINE" prompt over an asteroid.
* **Action Approach Prompts:** When a `Trigger Action` is initiated, the UI must clearly present the choice to `Act Risky` or `Act Cautiously` before the `Action Check` is rolled.
* **Status Display:** The HUD must provide clear, easy-to-read information on player and target ship status (e.g., hull integrity, active status effects).
