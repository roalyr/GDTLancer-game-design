## 1. Overview

This document outlines the foundational lore for the GDTLancer universe. This history informs game mechanics, dialogue, design, and technology. The game takes place in **Sectors**, which can be a star system or other distinct region, keeping travel distances manageable.

## 2. The Exodus and The Pillar

* **Origin:** The people of the Opulence system descend from groups who left Earth centuries ago.
* **The Pillar:** Their generation ship, "The Pillar," was built for a multi-century journey, prioritizing durability and self-sufficiency.
* **Functionality:** The Pillar is a rotating cylinder that generates sub-1g gravity. Its fully enclosed systems maintained a controlled, low-pressure atmosphere and a closed-loop ecosystem.
* **Purpose:** The exodus was a one-way trip to establish a new, autonomous civilization, away from Earth's conflicts and ecological issues.

## 3. The Anomaly and Arrival

* **Interstellar Transit:** The voyage ended after passing through a spatio-temporal distortion known as "the Anomaly."
* **Dislocation:** The Anomaly caused an uncontrolled spatial displacement, throwing The Pillar into an uncharted region of space. A temporal shift is also suspected.
* **Arrival:** The Pillar eventually stopped near a G-type star, where the "Opulence" system was settled.
* **Resource Shift:** Opulence is rich in energy, but raw matter for construction and repair is scarce. This scarcity defines the system's economy and culture.

## 4. Post-Arrival: Shaping a Civilization

* **Present Timeline:** The game is set 50-70 years after The Pillar's arrival. "Founders" (born on The Pillar) are elders in their 70s-90s. The "Voyagers" (the first generation born in Opulence) are adults in their 50s-70s and form the backbone of society. Younger generations are now often born in newer habitats off-Pillar.
* **The Pillar's Enduring Role:** The Pillar was repurposed into the system's central hub for energy collection, refining, fabrication, and knowledge archival. It remains the primary deep-space port.
* **Initial Expansion:** Early efforts focused on building survey vessels and automated mining tools. Asteroid mining established material self-sufficiency, allowing for the construction of smaller satellite habitats.

## 5. The People of Opulence: Generations & Adaptation

* **Founders:** This older generation holds the memory of the long voyage. They are seen as experienced, patient, and detail-oriented, valuing established procedures and knowledge preservation.
* **Voyagers:** The first generation born in Opulence is pragmatic and resourceful, shaped by energy abundance and matter scarcity. They focus on practical expansion and resource acquisition.
* **Population Value:** Each individual is highly valued due to historical population limits and a continued scarcity of skilled labor. This underlies the game's focus on meaningful agent interactions.
* **Physiological Legacy:** Centuries in a controlled environment have led to subtle physiological differences, such as a preference for lower-G and better tolerance for minor radiation, which are considered normal.

## 6. Culture of Pragmatism & Resilience

* **Environmental Disposition:** Planetary surfaces are not feared, but seen as inefficient and resource-intensive to settle compared to asteroids and void habitats, which offer better environmental control.
* **Core Values:** The culture values pragmatism, utilitarianism, and self-sufficiency. Resourcefulness and efficiency are highly respected. "Waste not, want not" is a common adage.
* **Social Structure:** Family units are often based on mutual support and contribution. Meritocracy based on practical skills is central to social standing.
* **Internal Conflict and Resolution:** Competition over resources, trade routes, or patents is common. Destructive warfare is avoided due to its high cost. Disputes are resolved through negotiation, arbitration, or structured "trials" to preserve assets and personnel.
* **The 'Lancer' Combat Doctrine:** When disputes escalate, they are handled through specialized ship-to-ship engagements designed for controlled neutralization, not destruction.
    * **Melee Focus:** The core of this doctrine, the "Lancer" paradigm, emphasizes close-quarters combat using durable industrial tools (lances, grapples, rams). This conserves matter and allows for asset recovery.
    * **Reclaimable Projectiles:** Projectile weapons are rare and typically designed to be recoverable. They are used strategically to disable or capture.
    * **Limited Casualties:** The goal is to disable, capture, or compel surrender, reflecting the high value of pilots and their ships.

## 7. Technology, Expansion & Human Interface

* **Technological Evolution:** Technology is an iteration of The Pillar's original systems, emphasizing reliability, modularity, and efficiency.
* **Research Focus:** Key development areas include robotics, small vessel design, efficient fabrication, asteroid mining, and advanced propulsion.
* **Exploration & Settlement:** Exploration is driven by practical needs for resources and outpost locations. Settlements are utilitarian void habitats or modified asteroids.

### 7.1. G-Stasis Cradle

* **Purpose:** A standard system in all high-performance ships that allows pilots to withstand extreme G-forces.
* **Components:** A mechanical and bio-support system including an Exo-Harness, Active Contour Bladders for bracing, a Pressurized Breathing System, and Neuro-Biological Support for chemical and neural assistance.

## 8. Naming Conventions (Outline)

* **Cultural Synthesis:** Names reflect a blend of diverse Earth cultures from The Pillar's journey.
* **Given Names:** A mix of traditional Earth names, often simplified. New names may emerge from significant events.
* **Surnames:** Can be inherited Earth names or functional names reflecting ancestral roles (e.g., "Engineer-Chang," "Pilot-Nia").
* **Language:** A practical and direct creole lingua franca with heavy technical jargon.

## 9. Ambient Lore Implementation Goal

The player experiences this history through its consequences on game mechanics, dialogue, and design, minimizing direct exposition in favor of "showing, not telling."
