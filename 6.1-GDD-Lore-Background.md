## 1. Overview

This document outlines the foundational setting and background for the GDTLancer universe. This information informs game mechanics, dialogue, design, and technology.

## 2. The Premise: A Sector of Colonists

The game takes place in a hand-crafted sector of space populated by a human-centric society of early colonists and explorers. The specific history of *how* or *why* humanity arrived in this sector is left undefined. The narrative focus is on the current state of the sector and the player's actions within it.

## 3. Core Theme: Scarcity and Pragmatism

The primary driver of the setting is a considerable, but not punishing, scarcity of complex materials and skilled labor. This dynamic has forged a pragmatic, resilient, and resourceful culture.
* **Core Values:** The culture values efficiency, function-over-form ("Pragmatic Aesthetics"), and resourcefulness. "Waste not, want not" is a common adage.
* **Value of Assets:** Because of this scarcity, complex assets (like ships) and skilled personnel (like pilots) are highly valued and treated as quasi-irreplaceable.

## 4. The "Preservation Convention"

This cultural and economic reality has led to a widespread social norm known as the **Preservation Convention**.
* **Core Tenet:** This convention prioritizes the disablement, disarming, and capture of vessels over their outright destruction. Destroying a valuable ship and skilled pilot is seen as wasteful and unprofitable.
* **Conflict:** This creates a natural source of conflict, as fringe groups or sociopaths who *break* this convention are treated as a significant threat by the general society.
* **Industrial Tactics:** This convention favors the high-thrust application of industrial tools (grapples, reinforced prows, drills) in close-quarters engagements to disable, rather than annihilate, an opponent.

## 5. Technology & Aesthetics

* **Technological Baseline:** Technology is grounded and functional, iterating on known, reliable systems. The aesthetic is function-first, emphasizing reliability and modularity.
* **G-Stasis Cradle:** A key piece of in-lore technology standard in all high-performance ships. It is a bio-support system that allows a pilot to survive the extreme G-forces (e.g., up to 15G) generated by aggressive maneuvering or the use of high-thrust industrial tools in combat.
* **Travel:** Common Faster-Than-Light travel does not exist. Travel *within* a sector is done via in-system engines. Travel *between* sectors is a significant strategic undertaking, abstracted as a high cost in **Wealth Points (WP)** and **Time Units (TU)**.

## 6. Naming Conventions (Outline)

* **Cultural Synthesis:** Names reflect a blend of diverse Earth cultures.
* **Language:** A practical and direct creole lingua franca with heavy technical jargon.

## 7. Ambient Lore Implementation Goal

The player experiences this setting through its consequences on game mechanics (like the combat module), dialogue, and design, minimizing direct exposition in favor of "showing, not telling."
