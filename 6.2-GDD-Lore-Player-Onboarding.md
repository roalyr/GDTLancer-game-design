## 1. Purpose and Goals

This document outlines the player's first 30-60 minutes of gameplay. The goal is to introduce core systems smoothly without being overwhelming.

* **Teach Core Mechanics:** Introduce Action Checks, the `Risky`/`Cautious` system, and core resources (FP, WP, TU).
* **Show the Gameplay Loop:** Demonstrate how to accept a goal, travel, perform actions, and receive a reward.
* **Introduce the Setting:** Convey the pragmatic culture, resource scarcity, and the "Lancer" combat mindset through action.
* **Provide a Clear Next Step:** End the tutorial with a clear, player-driven objective.

## 2. Onboarding Philosophy

* **Guided, Not Forced:** Give the player a clear starting goal within a small, controlled area, but allow for experimentation.
* **Learn by Doing:** Introduce mechanics as they are needed. Explain the Action Check when the player first needs to make one.
* **Contextual Introduction:** Frame the tutorial within a simple story that organically reveals aspects of the game's lore and culture.

## 3. Onboarding Scenario: "The First Contract"

This scenario introduces the player to the game's core loop and establishes their place in the world.

* **Setup:** The player is a new pilot with a basic, second-hand ship, docked at a small habitat. Their mentor, a senior 'Voyager' engineer, guides them through their first official contract. This immediately grounds the player in the generational lore.

* **Step 1: The Mentor & The Goal**
    * The Mentor NPC gives the player a simple contract: retrieve a specific, salvageable component from a nearby, stable debris field.
    * **Introduces:** The Goal System, basic dialogue interaction.

* **Step 2: Travel & Time**
    * The mentor instructs the player to fly to the debris field. The flight is short and direct.
    * **Introduces:** Basic Piloting controls, the concept of spending Time Units (TU), and the Time Clock.

* **Step 3: The First Action Check**
    * At the debris field, the player must scan for the component. This is their first **Action Check**.
    * **Introduces:** The Action Check mechanic, the `Risky`/`Cautious` choice, and the use of Focus Points (FP).

* **Step 4: A Minor Complication**
    * The component is found, but it's stuck under a larger piece of debris. The player must use their ship's manipulator arm to carefully pry it loose. This requires another Action Check.
    * **Introduces:** How tools are used to solve problems; reinforces the Action Check mechanic.

* **Step 5: Controlled Conflict**
    * On the return trip, a lone scavenger in a poorly-maintained ship intercepts them and demands the component. This is a controlled combat tutorial.
    * The mentor advises the player to disable the scavenger's ship (reduce its hull to zero) without completely destroying it, calling annihilation "wasteful."
    * **Introduces:** The Combat Module, targeting the enemy hull, and the core principle of the Lancer Doctrine (avoiding destruction to preserve assets).

* **Step 6: The Reward & Next Steps**
    * The player returns the component to the mentor. They receive their first **Wealth Point (WP)** as payment.
    * The mentor congratulates them and points them to the station's job board, explaining how to find new contracts.
    * **Introduces:** The Wealth (WP) resource and the systems for finding new, player-driven goals. The tutorial is now complete, and the player is free to choose their next action.
