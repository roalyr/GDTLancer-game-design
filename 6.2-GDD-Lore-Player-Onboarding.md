## 1. Purpose and Goals

This document outlines the player's first 30-60 minutes of gameplay. The goal is to introduce core systems smoothly without being overwhelming.

* **Teach Core Mechanics:** Introduce Action Checks, the `Risky`/`Cautious` system, and core resources (FP, WP, TU).
* **Show the Gameplay Loop:** Demonstrate how to accept a goal, travel, perform actions, and receive a reward.
* **Introduce the Setting:** Convey the pragmatic culture, resource scarcity, and the "Preservation Convention" mindset through action.
* **Provide a Clear Next Step:** End the tutorial with a clear, player-driven objective.

## 2. Onboarding Philosophy

* **Guided, Not Forced:** Give the player a clear starting goal within a small, controlled area, but allow for experimentation.
* **Learn by Doing:** Introduce mechanics as they are needed. Explain the Action Check when the player first needs to make one.
* **Contextual Introduction:** Frame the tutorial within a simple story that organically reveals aspects of the game's setting and culture.

## 3. Onboarding Scenario: "The First Contract"

This scenario introduces the player to the game's core loop and establishes their place in the world.

* **Setup:** The player is a new pilot with a basic, second-hand ship, docked at a small habitat. Their mentor, a senior, experienced engineer, guides them through their first official contract. This immediately grounds the player in the pragmatic, hands-on culture of the sector.

* **Step 1: The Mentor & The Goal**
    * The Mentor NPC gives the player a simple contract: a rival salvage crew has disabled a small cargo drone but failed to secure it. The drone is now adrift at a known coordinate. The player's contract is to fly to the drone and retrieve its secure data core.
    * **Introduces:** The Goal System, basic dialogue interaction, and the setting's focus on salvage.

* **Step 2: Travel & Time**
    * The mentor instructs the player to fly to the drone's coordinates. The flight is short and direct.
    * **Introduces:** Basic Piloting controls, the concept of spending Time Units (TU), and the Time Clock.

* **Step 3: The First Action Check**
    * Upon arriving, the player finds the drone, but its data port is damaged. The player must use their ship's tools to carefully access the core. This is their first **Action Check**.
    * **Introduces:** The Action Check mechanic, the `Risky`/`Cautious` choice, and how tools are used to solve problems.

* **Step 4: Controlled Conflict**
    * Just as the player secures the core, the rival salvage ship (a lone scavenger) that originally disabled the drone returns and demands the core. This is a controlled combat tutorial.
    * The mentor advises the player to disable the scavenger's ship (reduce its hull to zero) without completely destroying it, calling annihilation "wasteful" and "a good way to get a bad reputation."
    * **Introduces:** The Combat Module, targeting the enemy hull, and the core principle of the Preservation Convention (avoiding destruction to preserve assets).

* **Step 5: The Narrative Resolution (The Payoff)**
    * After the rival ship is neutralized (Hull Integrity at 0), the **Narrative Action** menu appears. The mentor explains this is where the "real work" is done.
    * The player is presented with options like **"Assess the Aftermath"** and **"Claim Wreckage"**.
    * The mentor guides them to **"Assess the Aftermath"**. The player makes an Action Check (using their `Tactics Skill`).
    * **Outcome (example):** On a Success, the mentor says, "Good. You scanned their ship data. They're small-time, no faction. As per convention, activate their distress beacon. We have what we came for."
    * **Introduces:** The core TTRPG loop: **Skill-based play followed by TTRPG-style narrative resolution.** It shows *how* you handle a disabled vessel (assess it and leave it for recovery, as per the Convention).

* **Step 6: The Reward & Next Steps**
    * The player returns the data core to the mentor. They receive their first **Wealth Point (WP)** as payment.
    * The mentor congratulates them and points them to the station's job board, explaining how to find new contracts.
    * **Introduces:** The Wealth (WP) resource and the systems for finding new, player-driven goals. The tutorial is now complete.
