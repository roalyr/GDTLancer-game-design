## 1. Purpose & Challenge

* **Purpose:** This document outlines the strategy and considerations for player onboarding in GDTLancer, aiming to smoothly introduce players to the game's various interconnected systems and mechanics.
* **Challenge - Information Density:** GDTLancer features a rich set of mechanics (Gameplay Modules, Development Layers, Core Systems like Events & Goals, resources like Focus Points, Wealth Points, Time Units, and core resolution mechanics like Action Checks and Action Approaches). While this depth is a core design goal, presenting it all at once can be overwhelming for new players, potentially hindering their engagement and enjoyment.

## 2. Guiding Principles for Onboarding

The onboarding process will adhere to the following principles, aligning with the UI/UX Principles (GDD-Main, Section 6) that emphasize clarity and accessibility:

* **Gradual Introduction:** Core systems and mechanics will be introduced sequentially, not simultaneously. Each new element should build upon previously understood concepts.
* **Contextual Learning ("Just-in-Time Teaching"):** Mechanics and systems will be taught when they become directly relevant to the player's current situation, goals, or available actions. Avoid front-loading all information.
* **Learn by Doing:** Prioritize interactive tutorials, guided first experiences, and simple introductory tasks over passive text dumps or lengthy unskippable cutscenes.
* **Layered Complexity:** Allow players to engage with the basic functionality of a system first. Advanced options, strategic depth, and intricate inter-system synergies can be revealed or unlocked later, or be opt-in for players seeking mastery.
* **Clear & Immediate Feedback:** The UI/UX must provide clear, concise, and immediate feedback for player actions and the status of relevant systems (e.g., changes in FP, WP, Time Clock progression).
* **Reinforcement & Repetition:** Provide opportunities for players to safely practice and reinforce learned mechanics in low-stakes environments before they become critical.
* **Optional Depth & Player Pacing:** While core concepts are essential, deep mastery of all system interplays should be optional for basic game progression and enjoyment, rewarding players who invest more time in understanding. Players should feel a degree of control over the pace of learning.
* **Minimal Hand-Holding Post-Introduction:** While initial guidance is crucial, the onboarding should aim to empower players to explore and experiment independently once core concepts are grasped.

## 3. Onboarding Phases & Strategies

The onboarding process will be woven into the early stages of gameplay, likely corresponding with the player character's initial experiences as a "Voyager."

* **Phase 1: Core Piloting & Resource Awareness (First Hour)**
    * **Introduction:** Basic 3D ship movement and controls (Manual Flight).
    * **First System Introduced:** The **Time Clock** and **Time Units (TU)**, introduced via initial short-range travel or simple tasks that consume time.
    * **First Action:** A very simple, low-stakes **Trigger Action** that introduces the concept of an **Action Check** (perhaps without modifiers initially, or with a clearly explained, fixed positive modifier).
    * **First Meta-Resource:** Introduction to **Focus Points (FP)** and their basic use in boosting an Action Check. The FP gain/loss cycle should be experienced early.
    * **UI/UX Focus:** Clear HUD elements for ship status, TU/Time Clock, and FP. Contextual tooltips for these elements on their first appearance.
    * **Example Scenario:** A "maiden voyage" or a simple delivery task within a safe, contained area of the Opulence system, perhaps guided by a Founder NPC or a senior Voyager.

* **Phase 2: Understanding Consequences & Choices (Hours 1-3)**
    * **Introduction:** The **Action Approach** system (`Act Risky` / `Act Cautiously`) introduced in a scenario with clear branching outcomes.
    * **Module Modifiers:** The concept of skills and asset difficulties influencing the `Module Modifier` is introduced as the player undertakes slightly more complex tasks or acquires their first basic asset/upgrade.
    * **Second Meta-Resource:** Introduction to **Wealth Points (WP)** through a significant first reward or a necessary major expenditure (e.g., critical ship component, essential data).
    * **Event System Teaser:** A simple, impactful event (from the Event System) occurs, perhaps as a direct consequence of an Action Check, demonstrating how the world can react unexpectedly.
    * **Goal System Introduction:** The player is given their first clear short-term **Goal** (via the Goal System), with a visible **Progress Track**.
    * **UI/UX Focus:** Clear presentation of Action Check outcomes, Action Approach choices, WP balance, and active goals.

* **Phase 3: Broader Systems & World Interaction (Hours 3+)**
    * **World Event Tick:** The player experiences their first **World Event Tick** after the Time Clock fills, including the associated **WP Upkeep** cost. This naturally introduces the longer-term economic pressures.
    * **Introduction to Other Modules:** As goals and opportunities arise, the player is guided towards new Gameplay Modules (e.g., basic Trading, Mining, or responding to a distress signal leading to a simple Combat encounter). Each new module will have its own mini-tutorial or guided experience.
    * **Chronicle System Introduction:** The player discovers how to access or is shown the Chronicle System, seeing their (and perhaps other Agents') significant actions logged.
    * **Deeper System Interactions:** Contextual hints or advanced tutorials can start to explain how systems like Events, Goals, and Agent actions influence each other and the World State.
    * **Lore Integration:** Information from the Lore & Background GDD is revealed organically through dialogue, environmental details, and system behaviors rather than info-dumps.

## 4. Specific Onboarding Techniques

* **Interactive Checklists/Tutorial Pop-ups:** Non-intrusive, dismissible prompts that guide the player through their first interaction with a new UI element or mechanic.
* **"Show, Don't Just Tell" Scenarios:** Craft early game situations or mini-quests that inherently require the use of a specific mechanic to succeed, making the learning process part of the gameplay.
* **Mentorship Dialogue:** Short, contextual dialogue from key NPCs (e.g., a Founder mentor, a fellow Voyager) offering advice or explaining a new concept as it becomes relevant.
* **Glossary/Codex:** An in-game accessible reference for all key terms, mechanics, and lore snippets the player has encountered, as per GDD-Main UI/UX Principles.
* **Visual Cues:** Highlighting relevant UI elements when a new system is introduced or becomes critical.
* **Safe Failure States:** Early tutorials should allow for "failure" (e.g., failing an Action Check) without overly punitive consequences, allowing players to learn from mistakes. The outcome should clearly explain *why* a failure occurred.

## 5. Onboarding & Game Layers

The game's layered development approach (GDD-Main, Section 4.2) naturally supports a layered onboarding:

* **Layer 1 Mechanics (Core Simulation & Mechanics):** Will form the bulk of initial onboarding.
* **Layer 2 Mechanics (Narrative Integration):** Introduced once the player has a grasp of basic actions and resource management.
* **Layer 3 Mechanics (World & Agency Simulation):** The impact of these (NPC actions, World State changes) will become apparent more gradually as the player spends more time in the game, rather than being explicitly taught as a "system" the player must manage directly from the start.

## 6. Iteration & Player Feedback

The onboarding process will require significant iteration and playtesting. Feedback from new players will be crucial in refining the pacing, clarity, and effectiveness of the tutorial systems. The goal is to make the rich mechanics of GDTLancer accessible and engaging, not a barrier to entry.
