## 1. Core Principles

* **Function over Form:** Design prioritizes a clear purpose over aesthetics.
* **Integrated Hull:** The design is a complete, pre-designed spaceframe, not assembled from modular chassis parts.
* **Lived-In Aesthetic:** Ship shows signs of maintenance and historical use (wear, patches, modifications).

## 2. Propulsion Systems

### 2.1. Main Engines

* **"Rock-Eater" (Chemical - Baseline)**
    * **Propellant:** Powdered metals (Al, Fe) + Oxidizer (from rock/ice).
    * **Niche:** Common, reliable, low-performance.
* **"Ice-Drinker" (Chemical - High-Performance)**
    * **Propellant:** Hydrolox or Methalox (from ice deposits).
    * **Niche:** High-thrust vessels; requires targeted prospecting.
* **"Gas-Sipping" (Chemical - Specialist)**
    * **Propellant:** Ramscoop-collected hydrogen from nebulae.
    * **Niche:** Extreme range within nebulae, low sustainable thrust.
* **Nuclear Thermal Rocket (NTR)**
    * **Mechanism:** Fission reactor superheats a secondary propellant.
    * **Niche:** Top-tier performance. Extremely expensive to refuel.

### 2.2. Emergency Propulsion

* **Cold Gas Thrusters**
    * **Mechanism:** Vents inert, pressurized gas.
    * **Niche:** Low-thrust emergency use. Simple, reliable, independent of main propellant.
* **Microwave / Resistojet Thrusters**
    * **Mechanism:** Uses electricity to heat any available mass (e.g., waste gas) into plasma.
    * **Niche:** Very low thrust, high-efficiency "get-home" engine. Requires significant power.

## 3. Power Plants

* **Solar Panels**
    * **Niche:** Baseline power generation. Low output, ineffective far from a star.
* **Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)**
    * **Niche:** Low, constant power output for extreme durations. Ideal for emergency backup or low-power "dark running".
* **Fuel Cells**
    * **Niche:** Mid-grade power. Consumes propellant (e.g., hydrogen) to generate electricity. Better output than solar, but requires fuel.
* **Fission Reactor**
    * **Fuel:** Rare Uranium/Thorium ores from asteroids.
    * **Niche:** High-end, long-duration power source. Essential for deep space operations.

## 4. Cooling Systems

* **Standard Radiators**
    * **Niche:** Basic, durable heat dissipation. Bulky, often with exposed, vulnerable elements.
* **Cryo-Coolers**
    * **Niche:** High-efficiency, active cooling for advanced systems. More compact, requires power, more fragile.

## 5. Life Support Systems

* **Open-Loop System**
    * **Niche:** Consumes stored consumables. Limits mission duration. Standard on short-range vessels.
* **Closed-Loop Recycler**
    * **Niche:** Recycles air and water using Pillar-derived technology. Extends mission endurance significantly.
* **G-Stasis Cradle**
    * **Function:** Mitigates extreme G-forces.
    * **Components:** Exo-Harness, Contour Bladders, Pressurized Breathing, Neuro-Biological Support.

## 6. Radiation Protection

* **Baseline Hull Shielding**
    * **Niche:** Standard hull materials offer minimal protection from cosmic radiation and solar flares. Sufficient only for short-duration, in-system travel.
* **Dense Core Laminate**
    * **Niche:** Heavy, layered armor with a dense material core. Offers significant radiation protection for deep space travel at the cost of increased mass.

---

## 7. Turbomachinery

* **Standard Mechanical Pumps**
    * **Niche:** Baseline pumps for propellant and coolant. Heavy, durable, and power-inefficient.
* **Single-Crystal Blisk Turbopumps**
    * **Niche:** Advanced, high-performance pumps. Fabricated from exotic single-crystal alloys for extreme efficiency, low mass, and high durability. Complex and costly.

## 8. External Hardpoints & Utility Tools

Tools often serve dual purposes for industry and combat, per the Lancer Doctrine.

### 8.1. Mining & Salvage Tools

* **Rotary Mining Drill:** Precision ore extraction. Doubles as a close-range lance.
* **Reinforced Prow:** Brute-force asteroid fracturing. Doubles as a melee ram.
* **High-Power Ablative Laser:** Skims trace elements from surfaces. Can strip ship armor or damage exposed external systems.
* **Seismic Charge Launcher:** Controlled demolition of asteroids via expensive consumables. Can target ship subsystems.

### 8.2. Capture & Control Tools

* **Harpoon & Winch Array:** Tethers asteroids or ships. Functions as a recoverable projectile.

### 8.3. Gas/Debris Collectors

* **Magnetic Ramscoop:** Passively collects nebula gas for "Gas-Sipping" engines.
* **Forward-Facing Debris Scoop:** Actively collects fragments from wreckage or fractured asteroids.

## 9. Energy Storage

* **High-Capacity Battery Banks**
    * **Niche:** High-storage, low-power-output. Stores large energy reserves from power plants but has a slow discharge rate.
* **Supercapacitors**
    * **Niche:** High-power-output, low-storage. Discharges almost instantly for high-draw systems (lasers, engine startup).

## 10. Size & Mass Characteristics

* **Size Range:** 20 to 40 meters in length.
* **Mass Range:** Dry mass from ~20 metric tons (light vessels) to over 100 metric tons (heavy freighters).
* **Core Design:** Built around a compact, single-pilot life support pod with an integrated G-Stasis Cradle.

## 11. Construction Materials

* **Welded Steel & Composites (Baseline)**
    * **Niche:** Heavy, cheap, easy to repair. Standard for industrial vessels.
* **Titanium-Alloy Frame (Mid-Grade)**
    * **Niche:** Lighter and stronger than steel. Improves agility and durability for a higher cost.
* **Graphene-Reinforced Ceramics (High-End)**
    * **Niche:** Extremely light, durable, high heat resistance. Rare and difficult to repair.

## 12. Propellant Storage

### 12.1. Solid Propellant (Powders/Metals)

* **Unpressurized Hopper**
    * **Niche:** Baseline solid fuel storage. Heavy, simple, potential for inconsistent fuel feed.
* **Agitated Silo**
    * **Niche:** Advanced storage. Uses mechanisms to prevent clumping and ensure a consistent fuel feed to the engine.

### 12.2. Liquid & Cryogenic Propellant

* **Insulated Dewar Tank**
    * **Niche:** Baseline liquid storage. Passive insulation results in inevitable fuel boil-off over time, limiting mission duration.
* **Active Cryocooler Tank**
    * **Niche:** High-end cryogenic storage. Uses power to actively cool the propellant, eliminating boil-off. Essential for long-haul cryogenic-fueled ships.
