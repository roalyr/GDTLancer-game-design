## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design philosophy for all ships in GDTLancer. It aims to balance in-game lore with the need for clear and engaging ship designs. The core principle is **Pragmatic Aesthetics**: function dictates form.

## 2. Core Principles

* **Pragmatic Aesthetics:** Designs prioritize function, reliability, and modularity. Born from a culture of resource scarcity and engineering pragmatism, a ship's look should communicate its purpose. Ornamentation is rare and seen as wasteful.
* **Modular Design:** Ships are built from modular components (thrusters, cockpits, cargo bays, weapon mounts). This makes them easier to repair, upgrade, and customize, reinforcing the setting's iterative approach to technology.
* **"Lived-In" Feel:** Ships should look used and maintained, not pristine. Scratches, patch repairs, and external modifications show a history of use. Designs may be asymmetrical if it serves a functional purpose.

## 3. The Lancer Combat Doctrine

The Lancer Doctrine is a combat philosophy born from the dual scarcities of raw matter and skilled personnel. Its primary goal is not destruction, but the controlled neutralization of an opponent to capture assets and preserve life. This doctrine directly shapes the design and function of all combat-capable ships.

* **Close-Quarters Engagement:** The doctrine favors close-range combat where precision is possible. This minimizes wasted energy and allows for the use of durable, low-cost tools. Ship designs often feature heavy forward armor and reinforced frames.
* **Adapted Industrial Tools (Melee):** Instead of disposable ammunition, combat often relies on adapted industrial equipment like reinforced drills, cutting lances, and grappling arms. These tools are used to disable key ship systems like thrusters or power plants.
* **Recoverable Projectiles:** When ranged attacks are necessary, they use recoverable munitions. Examples include tethered harpoons, capture nets, or non-explosive kinetic slugs designed to be retrieved after a fight.
* **Asset Preservation:** The ultimate goal is to disable, not destroy. A disabled ship can be claimed, its pilot captured, and its cargo seized. This approach avoids the immense waste of destroying a valuable vessel and its skilled operator.

## 4. Ship Classes & Roles

Ship classes are defined by their intended role within the Lancer Doctrine. Many dedicated combat ships are heavily modified versions of standard industrial frames.

* **Lancer:** A close-quarters specialist designed to disable enemy vessels using adapted tools. Heavily armored in the front to protect it on approach.
* **Striker:** Utilizes recoverable projectiles like harpoons or kinetic slugs to cripple targets from a short distance before closing in or retreating.
* **Bastion:** A durable, heavily armored ship, often used for defense or to anchor a formation. May carry capture-oriented tools like nets or tractor beams.
* **Skirmisher:** A fast ship that excels at flanking and disabling specific external modules like thrusters or sensors. Lightly armored but hard to hit.
* **Industrial/Civilian:** Freighters, miners, tugs, and survey ships. Typically armed only for defense, but their sturdy frames are often the starting point for combat conversions.

## 5. Visual Language

The visual design should consistently reinforce the core principles.

* **Exposed Components:** Functional parts like pipes, heat sinks, and power conduits are often visible, showcasing the ship's mechanical nature.
* **Hard Edges:** Designs favor function-driven angles and simple geometric shapes over complex, organic curves.
* **Materiality:** Materials look real and functionalâ€”dented steel, welded plates, composite patches. Textures should emphasize function and wear.
* **Lighting:** Lighting is functional, used for visibility on viewports, docking guides, and warning indicators.
* **Color & Decals:** Color and decals identify faction and ownership, not for pure decoration. They are often applied practically, like stenciled serial numbers or faction logos.
