## 1. Overview

This document defines the asset configurations for shipboard energy storage systems. These components work in conjunction with **Power Plants** to manage a ship's electrical supply, either by storing large reserves or enabling rapid discharge for high-draw systems.

This document follows the standard 3-part structure:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards.
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The `Resource` properties for the `Asset System`.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore & Visuals (For Infocards)

| Asset Type | Visual & Lore Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"High-Capacity Battery Banks"** | Large, heavy banks of chemical batteries designed to store significant amounts of energy generated by the ship's power plant. They have a relatively slow discharge rate, making them suitable for providing sustained power or emergency backup, but not for peak loads. Visually, they are banks of simple, rugged containers. |
| **"Supercapacitors"** | Advanced energy storage using electrostatic fields rather than chemical reactions. They store less total energy than batteries but can discharge almost instantly, providing massive bursts of power for high-draw systems like Ablative Lasers or engine startups. Visually, they are more compact and complex modules. |

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (Asset Stats)

Energy Storage units will be defined as `Resource` files (e.g., `SupercapacitorBank.tres`) and managed by the `Asset System`. The `Asset System` will track the `current_charge_mj` for each unit.

### Energy Storage `Resource` Properties

| Asset Type | `capacity_mj` (float) | `max_discharge_rate_mw` (float) | `charge_efficiency` (float) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Battery Bank"** | 1000.0 (High Capacity) | 2.0 (Low Discharge) | 0.9 |
| **"Supercapacitors"** | 100.0 (Low Capacity) | 50.0 (High Discharge) | 0.95 |

### Implementation Notes

* **`capacity_mj`:** The total amount of energy (in megajoules) the unit can store.
* **`max_discharge_rate_mw`:** The maximum power (in megawatts) the unit can output instantaneously. Supercapacitors excel here, enabling high-draw tools.
* **Power Management:** The `Asset System` manages the flow of energy. Power Plants charge these storage units. When ship power draw exceeds plant output, the storage units discharge (up to their `max_discharge_rate_mw`) to cover the deficit. If draw exceeds *both* plant output and storage discharge rate, systems shut down.
* **`charge_efficiency`:** Represents energy lost during the charging process.

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

For the TTRPG, energy storage provides a buffer or enables peak power actions.

### Analogue Asset Stats

| Asset Type | Asset Difficulty (Tech) | `WP` Cost | Special Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Battery Bank"** | **0** (Standard) | Low | **Reserve Power:** Can spend **1 FP** to ignore the effects of a temporary power loss (e.g., failed Power Plant check) for 1 `TU`. |
| **"Supercapacitors"** | **+1** (Advanced) | Medium | **Peak Discharge:** Enables the use of assets requiring "Peak Power" (e.g., advanced lasers). Can spend **1 FP** to guarantee sufficient power for one activation of such an asset, even if Power Slots are currently insufficient. |

### Analogue Rules

* **Reserve Power:** Batteries provide a safety net against temporary power failures or insufficient generation.
* **Peak Discharge:** Supercapacitors are required for certain high-energy actions or assets, acting as an enabler and providing a way to push systems beyond normal limits using **Focus Points (FP)**.
* **Asset Difficulty (Tech):** Applies to `Action Checks` related to repairing or managing the energy storage system.
