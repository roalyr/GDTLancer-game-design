## 1. Overview

This document defines the asset configurations for propellant storage. This specifically covers storage for **liquid and cryogenic propellants** (like Liquid Oxygen (LOX) or liquid hydrogen for NTRs).

It does **not** cover solid propellant storage, as the "Rock-Eater" hybrid engine's solid fuel grain is considered an integral part of the engine casing itself.

This document follows the standard 3-part structure:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards.
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The `Resource` properties for the `Asset System`.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore, Visuals, & Dimensions (For Infocards)

| Asset Type | Visual & Lore Description | Baseline Dimensions (Lore) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Insulated Dewar Tank"** | The baseline liquid storage tank. It is a passive, heavily insulated vessel. While reliable, it cannot perfectly prevent boil-off, causing a slow loss of cryogenic fuel over time. This limits a ship's maximum mission duration. Visually, it is a simple, reinforced cylinder. | **35m³ Baseline:**<br>~3m diameter<br>~5m long |
| **"Active Cryocooler Tank"** | A high-end cryogenic storage tank. It uses active cooling systems (powered by the ship's reactor) to completely eliminate fuel boil-off. Essential for long-haul vessels or ships using advanced propellants (like NTRs). Visually, it is bulkier, with external power couplings and small radiator fins. | **35m³ Baseline:**<br>~3.5m diameter (with machinery)<br>~5m long |

### Lore Note (Baseline Configuration)

The standard ship configuration seen in Phase 1 (e.g., a "Spinal" hull with a "Cruiser" engine) uses **two "Insulated Dewar Tanks"** to hold its `~80t` LOX supply.

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (Asset Stats)

Propellant Tanks will be defined as `Resource` files (e.g., `InsulatedDewarTank.tres`) and managed by the `Asset System`. The `Asset System` will be responsible for tracking the `current_fuel_level` of each tank.

### Tank `Resource` Properties

| Asset Type | `capacity_m3` (float) | `boil_off_rate_per_tu` (float) | `power_draw_mw` (float) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Insulated Dewar"** | 35.0 | 0.01 (Example value) | 0.0 |
| **"Active Cryocooler"** | 35.0 | 0.0 | 0.5 (Example value) |

### Implementation Notes

* **`capacity_m3`:** The total volume of propellant the tank can hold.
* **`boil_off_rate_per_tu`:** This is the key mechanic. The `Time System`, upon advancing the `Time Clock`, will trigger a function in the `Asset System` to deduct this amount of fuel from all "Insulated Dewar Tanks."
* **`power_draw_mw`:** The "Active Cryocooler Tank" requires constant power from the ship's Power Plant (defined in `7.4-GDD-Assets-Power-Plants.md`). If power is lost, it reverts to behaving like a (less effective) Dewar tank.

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

For the tabletop TTRPG, the mechanical difference is abstracted into a simple rule that interacts with the `Time Clock` and `WP` systems.

### Analogue Asset Stats

| Asset Type | Asset Difficulty | `WP` Cost (Est.) | Special Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Insulated Dewar"** | **0** (Standard) | (Baseline) | **Boil-Off:** If a `World Event Tick` occurs while you are not docked at a station, lose 1 `Endurance` segment from your ship's engine. |
| **"Active Cryocooler"** | **0** (Standard) | **High** (Upgrade) | **Active Cooling:** Immune to propellant **Boil-Off**. (May fail if the ship's Power Plant gains a negative `Ship Quirk`). |

### Analogue Rules

* **Boil-Off:** This rule links the `Time Clock` to the `Endurance` stat of the engine, creating a resource drain over time.
* **Active Cooling:** This asset negates the `Boil-Off` rule, but is dependent on the ship's power system.
