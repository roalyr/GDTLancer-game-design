## 1. Overview

This document defines the player-facing engine configurations for GDTLancer. The initial entries ("Cruiser", "Balanced", "Brawler", "Interceptor") are scoped for Phase 1. Placeholders for future-phase technologies, such as Nuclear Thermal (NTR) and Microwave thrusters, are included for design completeness.

This document is broken into three sections to align with the project's transmedia goals:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards, aligning with the "Pragmatic Aesthetics".
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The `AgentTemplate` `.tres` values that drive the "fake physics" model.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore, Visuals, & Dimensions (For Infocards)

The Phase 1 hybrid engines are all configurations of the baseline **"Rock-Eater" (Chemical - Baseline)** propulsion system. Future technologies will have distinct characteristics.

| Engine Config. | Visual & Exhaust Description | Estimated Dimensions (Lore) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Cruiser"** | A rugged, reliable single-cylinder hybrid engine. Its plain, armored casing emphasizes a **no-frills, function-first** design, with minimal external components save for a single, heavily shielded LOX feed line. It features a **simple conical nozzle**. The exhaust is a tight, stable, pale-blue or white flame. | **Baseline:**<br>Casing: ~8m long, ~2m diameter<br>Nozzle: ~2.5m wide<br>Total Length: ~9.5m |
| **"Balanced"** | A modified Cruiser chassis with visible performance upgrades. These include additional **heat shielding panels** and **small, passive radiator fins**. It uses a more pronounced **bell-shaped nozzle**. The exhaust is brighter, with visible **shock diamonds** (Mach diamonds). | **Variant of Cruiser:**<br>Casing: ~8m long, ~2.5m diameter (with fins)<br>Nozzle: ~3m wide<br>Total Length: ~10m |
| **"Brawler"** | Visibly aggressive, this engine's casing integrates prominent, **armored radiator panels**. The LOX feed lines are **thicker and more numerous**. It vents through a **single, very large, but relatively short and wide nozzle**. The exhaust is a violent, turbulent, orange-white plume. | **Variant of Cruiser:**<br>Casing: ~8m long, ~3.5-4m diameter (with radiators)<br>Nozzle: ~4m wide<br>Total Length: ~9m (short nozzle) |
| **"Interceptor"** | Not a traditional engine; it's a **rectangular or hexagonal armored block** that resembles a missile pod. Its surface has **visible seams** indicating where the entire cartridge cassette is loaded. The face is studded with the **many small, simple conical nozzles** of the individual cartridges. The "exhaust" is a massive, overwhelming, and short-lived **cloud of thick, dirty smoke and fire**. | **Module Block:**<br>~4m x 4m (face)<br>~2-3m (deep) |
| **Nuclear Thermal (NTR)** | *(Future Phase)* A complex, heavy engine built around a shielded fission reactor. The nozzle is large and advanced, designed to handle superheated propellant. Exhaust is a clean, intensely hot, and transparent or pale-colored plume. | TBD (Likely large/heavy) |
| **Microwave (Emergency)** | *(Future Phase)* A compact thruster block, often used as a backup. Features no large propellant casing, only power couplings and a small, complex nozzle array. Exhaust is a very faint, low-energy plasma glow. | TBD (Likely small module) |

### Lore Note (Propellant)

The note below applies to the Phase 1 "Rock-Eater" hybrid engines. Propellant for other technologies (NTR, etc.) will differ.

The "engine" casing (e.g., the `8m x 2m` cylinder of the Cruiser) contains the solid fuel. The baseline propellant load for a standard ship is assumed to be **~120 metric tons**. This is composed of:
* **~40t solid "Rock-Eater" fuel grain:** Housed within the engine casing itself. (The `8m x 2m` casing provides `~25.1m³` of volume, which fits 40t of high-density fuel composite).
* **~80t Liquid Oxygen (LOX):** Stored in **two external 35m³ cryotanks** (total `70m³` volume, matching the `~80t` mass of LOX), which are fed into the engine.

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (For `agent_template.gd`)

These are the *actual* gameplay parameters to be set in the `AgentTemplate` `.tres` resource files.

### `agent_template.gd` Values

| Engine Config. | `max_move_speed` | `acceleration` | `deceleration` | `max_turn_speed` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Cruiser"** | `500.0` | `0.3` | `0.3` | `0.6` |
| **"Balanced"** | `500.0` | `0.5` | `0.5` | `0.75` |
| **"Brawler"** | `500.0` | `0.8` | `0.8` | `1.1` |
| **Nuclear Thermal (NTR)** | `500.0` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| **Microwave (Emergency)**| `100.0` | `0.1` | `0.1` | `0.3` |

### Implementation Notes

* These values are the direct input for the "fake physics" `MovementSystem`.
* The `max_move_speed` (float) is the hard cap on velocity. The Microwave engine has a much lower cap, reflecting its "get-home" role.
* `acceleration` (float) is the `lerp` factor. This value is the final gameplay implementation of the `Thruster Power` stat required by the Piloting Module. A "Brawler" (`0.8`) will feel highly responsive, while a "Cruiser" (`0.3`) will feel heavy.
* `deceleration` (float) is the `lerp` factor for natural "drag".
* `max_turn_speed` (float) is the `slerp` factor for rotation. This is the implementation of the `Agility` stat. A "Brawler" (`1.1`) will be highly agile, while a "Cruiser" (`0.6`) will feel sluggish.
* **"Interceptor" (SRM):** This is **not** an `AgentTemplate` configuration. It will be implemented as a special *action* or *consumable asset* that, when activated, temporarily overrides the `MovementSystem.acceleration` with a massive value (e.g., `5.0` or higher) for a short, fixed duration.

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

These stats are for the tabletop TTRPG, aligning with the core rules for `Action Checks` and the `Analogue Setup`.

### Analogue Asset Stats

| Engine Config. | Asset Difficulty (Piloting) | Endurance (Segments / ~TU) | `WP` / Resource Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Cruiser"** | **-1** (Easy/Stable) | **~10 Segments** | Low (Standard Refuel) |
| **"Balanced"** | **0** (Standard) | **~6 Segments** | Low (Standard Refuel) |
| **"Brawler"** | **+2** (Hard/Volatile) | **~3 Segments** | High (Fast Refuel) |
| **"Interceptor"** | **+3** (Burst/Risky) | **1-2 Bursts** | Costs `WP` to re-arm cartridges. |
| **Nuclear Thermal (NTR)** | **+3** (Complex) | **~20+ Segments** | **Very High** (Requires Fission Fuel) |
| **Microwave (Emergency)** | **0** (Reliable) | Unlimited (Low-Thrust) | N/A (Consumes Power) |

### Analogue Rules

* **Asset Difficulty:** This modifier is applied to the player's `3d6 + Module Modifier` `Action Check` when piloting. A `Brawler` (+2) is more difficult and risky to control.
* **Endurance (Segments / ~TU):** Defines how many "travel segments" the ship can cover before refueling is required. Each segment of travel costs `Time Units (TU)`, which advances the `Time Clock`.
* **`WP` Cost:** The `Brawler` and `Interceptor` engines are a `Wealth Point (WP)` sink, representing their inefficiency and specialized re-arming/refueling needs. This drives the economic loop by costing the player `WP` at stations.
