## 1. Overview

This document defines the primary ship hull classes. A crucial design constraint is the **"Integrated Hull"** philosophy. Hulls are not modular chassis parts the player assembles; they are distinct, pre-designed spaceframes (ship classes) that the player acquires as a complete asset.

These integrated hulls are significant assets acquired through the **Asset Progression system**. Modularity is expressed by slotting components (like engines, tanks, and utility tools) into the pre-existing, specialized frames.

This document is broken into three sections:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards, based on the `Pragmatic Aesthetics`.
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The core stats (mass, cargo, slots) that each hull defines as a `Resource` within the `Asset System`.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules and stats for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore & Hull Descriptions (For Infocards)

| Hull Class | Visual & Design Philosophy | Lore Role & GDD Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Spinal"** | The baseline, pragmatic, function-first design. Its linear layout aligns all core components along a central thrust axis, making it the most straightforward and efficient versatile vessel. | The ubiquitous **freighter, explorer, or multi-role vessel**. The reference model used for the "Cruiser" engine is a perfect example of this common, reliable design. |
| **"Catamaran"** | A dual-hull frame designed for a specific industrial purpose: mounting oversized modules that wouldn't fit on a standard spinal frame. Features dual-engine mounts for redundancy and stable thrust. | A dedicated **Industrial Hauler or Salvage Platform**. The wide central space is designed to mount specialized tools like a **Forward-Facing Debris Scoop** or oversized cargo pods. |
| **"Trident"** | A triple-engine mount frame, over-engineered to support extreme power generation or acceleration. It is designed to handle high-draw systems like **Fission Reactors** or **Microwave Thrusters**. | A **high-end industrial or combat vessel**. It may be a **Deep-Space Miner** powering a **High-Power Ablative Laser**, or a **Lancer Interceptor** using raw acceleration for melee combat, as per the Lancer Doctrine. |
| **"Tower"** | Not a "Broadside Battleship," but a **"Broadside Grappler"**. Its purpose is to present a massive "tool wall" for disabling and capturing enemy vessels, perfectly aligning with the Lancer Doctrine's focus on **preservation of assets** and melee. | A specialized **salvage and capture vessel**. Its tactical role is to "catch" a target with a volley of **Harpoon & Winch Arrays**, then use **Rotary Drills** (as lances) and **Ablative Lasers** to systematically disable and capture it. |

### Lore Note (Enabling Technology)

All exotic hull designs, especially the high-G "Trident" and the lateral-strafing "Tower," are only viable due to the **G-Stasis Cradle**. This system allows pilots to survive the extreme and unusual acceleration vectors these specialized ships produce.

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (Asset Stats)

Ship Hulls will be defined as `Resource` files (e.g., `SpinalHull.tres`) and managed by the `Asset System`. These resources define the ship's core, non-performance stats and its component slots.

### Hull Base Stats & Slots

| Hull Class | Base Mass (t) | Base Cargo (units) | Engine Slots | Utility Slots (Est.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Spinal"** | 60 | 50 | 1 | 2 |
| **"Catamaran"** | 120 | 150 | 2 | 4 (Oversized) |
| **"Trident"** | 90 | 40 | 3 | 3 (High-Power) |
| **"Tower"** | 150 | 100 | 1 (Standard) | 8+ (Broadside) |

### Implementation Notes
* **`Base Mass (t)`:** This is the hull's dry mass. The `Asset System` will be responsible for the final "wet mass" calculation (Base Mass + Engine Mass + Cargo Mass + Fuel Mass) that provides the `Mass` stat required by the Piloting Module.
* **`Base Cargo (units)`:** This is the `Cargo Capacity` stat used by the `Inventory System` and Trading Module.
* **Slots:** These define the number and type of components (like engines from `7.2-GDD-Assets-Ship-Engines.md` or tools from `7.1-GDD-Assets-Ship-Design.md`) that can be slotted into the hull.

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

For the tabletop TTRPG, the hull provides base stats (like Hull Integrity) and, like engines, an `Asset Difficulty` modifier that stacks.

### Analogue Asset Stats

| Hull Class | Asset Difficulty (Global) | Base Hull | Base Cargo | Special Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Spinal"** | **0** (Baseline) | 10 | 5 | Standard, versatile. |
| **"Catamaran"** | **+1** (Sluggish) | 15 | 15 | Can mount 'Industrial' tools. `+1` to salvage-related `Action Checks`. |
| **"Trident"** | **+1** (High-G) | 12 | 4 | Can mount 3 engines. `+1` to `Act Risky` Piloting checks for interception. |
| **"Tower"** | **+2** (Unwieldy) | 20 | 10 | Can mount 'Broadside' tools. `+1` to all `Action Checks` for grappling or disabling targets. |

### Analogue Rules

* **Asset Difficulty:** This modifier stacks with the engine's modifier. The *final* `Module Modifier` for an `Action Check` is `Skill + Engine_Difficulty + Hull_Difficulty`. A "Trident" hull (+1) with a "Brawler" engine (+2) would have a total `+3` difficulty, making it very hard to control, which fits the lore.
* **Base Hull / Cargo:** These are the starting values for the asset.
* **Special Rule:** These provide a narrative and mechanical benefit that reinforces the hull's specific role.
