## 1. Overview

This document defines the asset configurations for shipboard power plants. These are a critical component, as they supply the necessary electricity for all other ship systems, from basic life support to high-draw modules like advanced engines, tools, and cooling systems.

The Phase 1 starting asset will be the basic "Solar Panels," with other plants available as goals via the **Asset Progression system**.

This document follows the standard 3-part structure:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards.
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The `Resource` properties for the `Asset System`.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore & Visuals (For Infocards)

| Asset Type | Visual & Lore Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Solar Panels"** | The baseline power source. Typically large, articulated "wings" of photovoltaic cells. Reliable and require no fuel, but suffer from low output and are ineffective in deep space or far from a star. |
| **"RTG"** | **(Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator)**. A small, heavy, and extremely durable power source with no moving parts. Provides a low but constant power output for extreme durations. Ideal for emergency backup or "dark running". |
| **"Fuel Cells"** | A mid-grade power system that consumes propellant (e.g., hydrogen) to generate electricity. Offers better output than solar panels but requires a steady fuel supply, limiting its endurance. |
| **"Fission Reactor"** | The high-end, long-duration power source. A compact, heavily-shielded reactor that provides massive power output. It is essential for deep space operations and high-draw modules, such as those found on "Trident" hulls. |

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (Asset Stats)

Power Plants will be defined as `Resource` files (e.g., `FissionReactor.tres`) and managed by the `Asset System`. The `Asset System` will track the ship's `current_power_output` vs. `current_power_draw`.

### Power Plant `Resource` Properties

| Asset Type | `power_output_mw` (float) | `fuel_type` (String) | `fuel_consumption_rate` (float) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Solar Panels"** | 1.0 (Baseline) | "None" | 0.0 |
| **"RTG"** | 0.5 | "None" | 0.0 |
| **"Fuel Cells"** | 5.0 | "Hydrogen" | 0.1 / TU |
| **"Fission Reactor"**| 20.0 | "Fission Fuel" | 0.01 / TU |

### Implementation Notes

* **`power_output_mw`:** The baseline power (in megawatts) the plant provides. The `Solar Panels`' output will be modified by a "solar_efficiency_factor" based on distance from the sector's star.
* **Power Management:** The `Asset System` must manage the ship's power budget. Modules like "Active Cryocooler Tanks", "Microwave Thrusters", and "Ablative Lasers" will add to the `current_power_draw`. If `draw > output`, systems will shut down, starting with non-essential modules.
* **`fuel_type` / `consumption_rate`:** The `Time System`, upon advancing the `Time Clock`, will trigger a function in the `Asset System` to consume fuel from the `Inventory System` for all fuel-consuming plants.

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

For the TTRPG, power is abstracted into "Power Slots," which represent how many high-draw modules a ship can support.

### Analogue Asset Stats

| Asset Type | Asset Difficulty (Tech) | `WP` Cost | Power Slots | Special Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Solar Panels"** | **0** (Simple) | (Baseline) | **1** | **Solar Dependent:** In deep space, `Power Slots` are reduced to 0. |
| **"RTG"** | **0** (Simple) | Low | **0** | **Always On:** Provides 0 `Power Slots`, but keeps basic life support running in any condition. |
| **"Fuel Cells"** | **+1** (Managed) | Medium | **2** | **Consumes Fuel:** Costs `1 WP` per `World Event Tick` to represent refueling. |
| **"Fission Reactor"** | **+2** (Complex) | Very High | **4** | **Consumes Fuel:** Costs `5 WP` (or rare item) per `World Event Tick` to represent refueling. |

### Analogue Rules

* **Power Slots:** High-draw assets (like an "NTR Engine" or "Ablative Laser") require 1 or more `Power Slots` to be functional.
* **Asset Difficulty (Tech):** This modifier applies to any `Action Check` related to repairing the power plant or managing a power-related crisis.
