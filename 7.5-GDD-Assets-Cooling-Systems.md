## 1. Overview

This document defines the asset configurations for shipboard cooling systems. Heat management is a critical aspect of the pragmatic ship design philosophy, as high-performance components like engines and power plants generate significant waste heat that must be dissipated to prevent damage or reduced efficiency.

This document follows the standard 3-part structure:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards.
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The `Resource` properties for the `Asset System`.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore & Visuals (For Infocards)

| Asset Type | Visual & Lore Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Standard Radiators"** | The baseline heat dissipation system. Consists of large, often external, radiator panels. They are bulky and potentially vulnerable but are reliable and require no power. These are seen integrated into the casing of "Balanced" and "Brawler" engines. |
| **"Cryo-Coolers"** | An advanced, high-efficiency active cooling system. More compact than standard radiators, they use power to significantly enhance heat dissipation, making them essential for high-output systems like Fission Reactors or NTR engines. They are, however, more fragile and complex. |

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (Asset Stats)

Cooling Systems will be defined as `Resource` files (e.g., `StandardRadiatorSet.tres`) and managed by the `Asset System`. The `Asset System` will track the ship's overall `current_heat_level` and `heat_dissipation_rate`.

### Cooling System `Resource` Properties

| Asset Type | `heat_dissipation_mw` (float) | `power_draw_mw` (float) | `fragility_modifier` (float) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Standard Radiators"** | 5.0 (Baseline) | 0.0 | 1.0 (Standard) |
| **"Cryo-Coolers"** | 20.0 | 2.0 | 1.5 (More fragile) |

### Implementation Notes

* **`heat_dissipation_mw`:** The amount of heat (in thermal megawatts) the system can dissipate per second.
* **Heat Management:** The `Asset System` must track the ship's `current_heat_level`. Components like Engines and Power Plants will *generate* heat based on their activity. The `Asset System` calculates the net heat change (`Heat Generated - Total Heat Dissipation`).
* **Overheating:** If `current_heat_level` exceeds a threshold, negative effects occur (e.g., reduced engine efficiency, component damage, potential for adding "Ship Quirks").
* **`power_draw_mw`:** Cryo-Coolers require power from a Power Plant. If power is insufficient, their dissipation rate drops significantly.
* **`fragility_modifier`:** A multiplier used by the `Combat Module` when determining the chance of this component being damaged or gaining a quirk. Cryo-Coolers are more susceptible to damage.

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

For the TTRPG, cooling is abstracted. The primary effect is enabling high-performance modules and managing an abstract "Heat" track during stressful situations.

### Analogue Asset Stats

| Asset Type | Asset Difficulty (Tech) | `WP` Cost | Special Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Standard Radiators"** | **0** (Simple) | (Baseline) | Provides **1 Heat Capacity**. Sufficient for standard operations. |
| **"Cryo-Coolers"** | **+1** (Complex) | Medium | Requires **1 Power Slot**. Provides **3 Heat Capacity**. Enables use of "High Heat" assets (like NTR). |

### Analogue Rules

* **Heat Capacity:** Represents how much stress the ship's systems can take before overheating. Certain `Action Check` failures (especially `Risky` piloting or combat actions) or specific events may add **Heat Points**.
* **Overheating:** If `Heat Points >= Heat Capacity`, the ship suffers a consequence (e.g., gains a negative "Ship Quirk", must spend `TU` to vent heat).
* **Enabling Assets:** Certain high-performance assets (like an NTR engine) might explicitly require "Cryo-Coolers" (or equivalent Heat Capacity) to function.
* **Asset Difficulty (Tech):** Applies to `Action Checks` for repairing the cooling system.
