## 1. Overview

This document defines the asset configurations for shipboard life support systems. These are essential for pilot survival and directly impact mission endurance by managing consumables or recycling vital resources. It also includes the critical **G-Stasis Cradle**, which enables high-performance maneuvering.

This document follows the standard 3-part structure:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards.
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The `Resource` properties for the `Asset System`.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore & Visuals (For Infocards)

| Asset Type | Visual & Lore Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Open-Loop System"** | The baseline life support system. Consumes stored consumables (oxygen, water, filters) to maintain a breathable atmosphere. Simple and reliable, but its limited supply restricts mission duration, making it standard only on short-range vessels. Visually represented by storage tanks and basic filtration units within the cockpit pod. |
| **"Closed-Loop Recycler"** | An advanced life support system utilizing advanced recycling technology. It actively recycles air and water, drastically reducing consumable usage and significantly extending mission endurance. Requires more power and maintenance. Visually, it includes more complex machinery, algae tanks, or chemical scrubbers. |
| **"G-Stasis Cradle"** | Not an environmental system, but a critical pilot support mechanism integrated into the ship's core design. It mitigates extreme G-forces during high-performance maneuvers. Includes an Exo-Harness, Active Contour Bladders, Pressurized Breathing apparatus, and Neuro-Biological Support systems. Enables the use of specialized hulls like the "Trident" and "Tower". |

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (Asset Stats)

Life Support systems will be defined as `Resource` files (e.g., `ClosedLoopRecycler.tres`) and managed by the `Asset System`. The `Asset System` will track `current_life_support_reserves`.

### Life Support `Resource` Properties

| Asset Type | `consumable_rate_per_tu` (float) | `power_draw_mw` (float) | `max_g_tolerance` (float) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Open-Loop"** | 0.1 (Example) | 0.1 | 5.0 (Baseline) |
| **"Closed-Loop"** | 0.01 (Reduced) | 0.5 | 5.0 (Baseline) |
| **"G-Stasis Cradle"** | 0.0 | 1.0 (Active) | 15.0+ (Enhanced) |

### Implementation Notes

* **`consumable_rate_per_tu`:** The `Time System`, upon advancing the `Time Clock`, will trigger the `Asset System` to deduct this amount from `current_life_support_reserves` (tracked in the `Inventory System`). Running out of reserves leads to mission failure or severe penalties.
* **`power_draw_mw`:** Closed-loop systems and the G-Stasis Cradle require power. Loss of power disables their benefits.
* **`max_g_tolerance`:** This stat interacts with the `Piloting Module`. If the ship's acceleration exceeds this value (possible with high-thrust engines or extreme maneuvers), the pilot suffers negative effects (e.g., temporary control loss, increased chance of `Action Check` failure). The G-Stasis Cradle drastically increases this threshold.

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

For the TTRPG, life support impacts mission endurance abstractly, while the G-Stasis Cradle enables specific maneuvers or ship types.

### Analogue Asset Stats

| Asset Type | Asset Difficulty (Tech) | `WP` Cost | Special Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Open-Loop"** | **0** (Standard) | (Baseline) | **Limited Duration:** After **10 TU** away from a station, gain the "Low Supplies" status (e.g., `-1` to all `Action Checks`). |
| **"Closed-Loop"** | **+1** (Complex) | Medium | **Extended Duration:** Extends the "Low Supplies" threshold to **30 TU**. Requires power. |
| **"G-Stasis Cradle"** | **+1** (Integrated) | (Included in Hull) | **High-G Maneuvers:** Required to pilot "Trident" or "Tower" hulls. Allows `Act Risky` Piloting checks involving extreme acceleration without automatic penalty. |

### Analogue Rules

* **Endurance:** The choice of life support system dictates how long a player can operate independently before needing to resupply, measured in **Time Units (TU)**. Running low imposes penalties.
* **G-Stasis Enablement:** The Cradle is a prerequisite for certain hulls and high-risk piloting actions, reinforcing the lore.
* **Asset Difficulty (Tech):** Applies to `Action Checks` related to repairing the life support system.
