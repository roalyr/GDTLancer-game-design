## 1. Overview

This document defines the asset configurations for shipboard radiation protection. Shielding against cosmic radiation and solar flares is crucial for pilot safety, especially during deep space travel or operation near hazardous phenomena.

This document follows the standard 3-part structure:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards.
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The `Resource` properties for the `Asset System`.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore & Visuals (For Infocards)

| Asset Type | Visual & Lore Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Baseline Hull Shielding"** | This represents the minimal radiation protection offered by standard ship construction materials (like Welded Steel). It is sufficient only for short-duration travel within relatively safe, charted space near habitats or major celestial bodies. It is not a distinct component, but an inherent property of basic hulls. |
| **"Dense Core Laminate"** | A significant upgrade involving heavy, layered armor with a dense material core (e.g., lead or depleted uranium analogues) integrated into the hull structure. It offers substantial protection against cosmic radiation and solar flares, making deep space travel viable, but at the cost of significantly increased mass. Visually, ships with this upgrade may appear bulkier or have thicker hull plating. |

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (Asset Stats)

Radiation Protection levels will likely be integrated as properties directly within the Hull `Resource` files (See `7.3-GDTLancer-Ship-Chassis.md`), rather than separate swappable components. The `Asset System` will expose this value.

### Hull Radiation Protection Property (Example within Hull Resource)

| Property Name | Data Type | Description | Baseline Value | Dense Core Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `radiation_shielding_factor` | `float` | Multiplier representing effectiveness (0.0 = none, 1.0 = perfect). | 0.2 | 0.8 |

### Implementation Notes

* **Radiation Zones:** Environmental zones in the game world will have a `radiation_level` property.
* **Exposure Calculation:** The `Asset System` or a dedicated "Pilot Health System" (future phase) will calculate radiation exposure over time based on the zone's `radiation_level` mitigated by the ship's `radiation_shielding_factor`.
* **Consequences:** High radiation exposure could lead to temporary penalties (e.g., reduced `Focus Points`), add negative `Ship Quirks` related to sensor interference, or trigger dangerous events.
* **Mass Penalty:** Hulls with "Dense Core Laminate" will have a significantly higher `Base Mass (t)`, impacting piloting performance.

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

In the TTRPG, radiation protection primarily acts as a gate for certain types of travel or exploration and mitigates specific hazards.

### Analogue Asset Stats (Integrated into Hull Sheet)

| Protection Level | `WP` Cost Modifier | Special Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Baseline Shielding"** | (Standard Hull Cost) | **Hazard Vulnerability:** When traveling through a "Radiation Hazard" zone, automatically gain 1 `Heat Point` per `TU` spent in the zone. |
| **"Dense Core Laminate"** | +High WP Cost (Hull Upgrade) | **Deep Space Capable:** Immune to the automatic `Heat Point` gain from "Radiation Hazard" zones. Required for travel segments marked "Deep Space Route". |

### Analogue Rules

* **Environmental Hazards:** Specific map locations or travel segments can be marked as "Radiation Hazards." Baseline shielding imposes a constant penalty (representing system strain and pilot stress) when in these areas.
* **Deep Space Gating:** Dense Core Laminate is a prerequisite for attempting certain long-range or exploratory journeys, representing a significant investment managed through the `Asset Progression` system.
* **Event Mitigation:** Specific event outcomes from the `Module Event Booklets` (e.g., solar flare encounter) might have reduced severity or be ignored entirely if the ship has Dense Core Laminate.
