## 1. Overview

This document defines the asset configurations for shipboard turbomachinery, specifically the pumps used for moving propellants and coolants. While often integrated directly into engines or other systems, their quality significantly impacts overall ship efficiency and reliability.

This document follows the standard 3-part structure:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards.
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The `Resource` properties for the `Asset System`.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore & Visuals (For Infocards)

| Asset Type | Visual & Lore Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Standard Mechanical Pumps"** | The baseline technology for fluid transfer. These are heavy, durable, but relatively power-inefficient mechanical pumps. Reliable workhorses found on most standard vessels. Visually represented as robust, blocky pump housings integrated near engines and tanks. |
| **"Single-Crystal Blisk Turbopumps"** | Advanced, high-performance turbopumps representing a significant technological step. Fabricated from exotic single-crystal alloys, these pumps combine the turbine and bladed disk into a single component ("blisk"), offering extreme efficiency, low mass, and high durability. Complex and costly, usually found on high-end engines or specialized industrial equipment. Visually smaller, more refined, possibly with diagnostic indicators. |

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (Asset Stats)

Turbopumps might be implemented as integrated properties within the Engine `Resource` files or potentially as swappable sub-components influencing engine performance.

### Example Properties (If Integrated into Engine Resource)

| Property Name | Data Type | Description | Standard Value | Blisk Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pump_efficiency_modifier` | `float` | Multiplier affecting fuel consumption or thrust output. | 1.0 | 1.1 (Example) |
| `pump_power_draw_mw` | `float` | Base power draw for pump operation. | 0.2 | 0.1 (More efficient) |
| `pump_reliability_factor` | `float` | Base chance modifier for pump-related failures/quirks. | 1.0 | 0.8 (More reliable) |

### Implementation Notes

* **Performance Impact:** Higher `pump_efficiency_modifier` could slightly increase the effective `acceleration` or decrease fuel consumption calculated by the `Asset System`.
* **Power Draw:** Contributes to the ship's overall power budget. Blisk pumps are more power-efficient.
* **Reliability:** The `pump_reliability_factor` influences the chance of failure events or gaining related "Ship Quirks" during stressful situations (e.g., combat damage, critical failures on `Action Checks`).

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

In the TTRPG, pump quality is abstracted into reliability and efficiency modifiers.

### Analogue Asset Stats (Likely Integrated into Engine Sheet)

| Pump Type | Asset Difficulty (Tech) | `WP` Cost Modifier | Special Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Standard Mechanical"** | **0** (Standard) | (Baseline Engine Cost) | Standard performance and reliability. |
| **"Single-Crystal Blisk"** | **+1** (Advanced) | +Medium WP (Engine Upgrade) | **Enhanced Efficiency:** Gain `+1` Endurance segment. **Reliable:** Ignore the first pump-related "Ship Quirk" gained. |

### Analogue Rules

* **Efficiency Bonus:** Blisk pumps directly improve the engine's core **Endurance** stat, representing better fuel management.
* **Reliability Bonus:** They provide resilience against specific types of failures or negative traits acquired through gameplay, reducing downtime or repair costs (`WP`).
* **Asset Difficulty (Tech):** Applies to `Action Checks` related to repairing the pumps or engine systems. Advanced Blisk pumps might be harder to fix in the field.
