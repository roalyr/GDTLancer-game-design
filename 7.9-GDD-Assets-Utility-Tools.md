## 1. Overview

This document defines the asset configurations for external hardpoint-mounted utility tools. These tools often serve dual purposes for both industry (mining, salvage) and combat, which is a core tenet of the **Preservation Convention**.

The specific tools available are the primary distinguishing feature for specialized hull classes like the "Catamaran" and "Tower".

**Design Note on Combat:** Per `5.2-GDD-Module-Combat.md`, these tools are the primary means of offense. There are **no energy shields**; combat is a "hard sci-fi" affair focused on disabling systems and overcoming hull integrity. These tools enable that specific gameplay.

This document follows the standard 3-part structure:
1.  **Lore & Visuals:** Descriptive text for in-game infocards.
2.  **Godot Implementation:** The `Resource` properties for the `Asset System`.
3.  **Analogue Implementation:** The abstracted rules for the tabletop TTRPG asset sheets.

## 2. Part 1: Lore & Visuals (For Infocards)

| Asset Type | Visual & Lore Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Rotary Mining Drill"** | A heavy-duty industrial drill designed for precision ore extraction from asteroids. Per the Preservation Convention, it doubles as a close-range tool for **breaching ship hulls** in a controlled manner. A key tool for "Tower" hulls. |
| **"Reinforced Prow"** | A structural modification that adds a reinforced "hard place" to the ship's bow. It is designed for controlled, high-thrust interactions (like pushing large salvage objects) rather than high-speed impacts. Its combat application is for **breaching, pinning, or bulldozing** disabled targets. |
| **"High-Power Ablative Laser"** | A high-draw energy tool. Its industrial use is to skim trace elements from asteroid surfaces. In combat, it is used to strip enemy armor or disable external systems without destroying the hull. Requires a **Fission Reactor**, common on "Trident" and "Tower" hulls. |
| **"Seismic Charge Launcher"** | A launcher that fires expensive, consumable charges for the controlled demolition of asteroids. In combat, these low-velocity charges can be used to target specific ship subsystems. |
| **"Harpoon & Winch Array"** | A recoverable projectile system. Industrially, it tethers asteroids for mining or towing. In combat, it is the primary tool for the "Broadside Grappler" tactic, allowing a "Tower" hull to tether and control a target. |
| **"Forward-Facing Debris Scoop"** | A massive, reinforced collector designed for actively scooping fragments from wreckage or fractured asteroids. It is an oversized module, requiring a specialized "Catamaran" hull to mount. |

## 3. Part 2: Godot Implementation (Asset Stats)

Utility Tools will be defined as `Resource` files (e.g., `RotaryDrill.tres`) and managed by the `Asset System`. These assets will be activated by the player and their logic handled by the relevant module (e.g., `Combat Module` or a future Mining module).

### Tool `Resource` Properties

| Asset Type | `power_draw_mw` (float) | `damage` (int) | `consumable_item_id` (String) | `slot_type` (String) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rotary Drill | 1.0 | 50 (Breach) | "None" | "Broadside" |
| Reinforced Prow | 0.0 | 40 (Thrust/Impact)| "None" | "Structural" |
| Ablative Laser | 15.0 | 20 (Energy) | "None" | "High-Power" |
| Seismic Charge Launcher | 0.5 | 100 (Explosive) | "SeismicCharge" | "Standard" |
| Harpoon & Winch | 2.0 | 5 (Kinetic) | "None" | "Broadside" |
| Debris Scoop | 1.0 | 0 | "None" | "Oversized" |

### Implementation Notes

* **`power_draw_mw`:** The power required from the ship's Power Plant when the tool is active. The `Asset System` tracks this against the plant's output. The "Ablative Laser" has a very high draw, requiring a "Fission Reactor".
* **`damage`:** The base damage value used by the `Combat Module`. The "Harpoon" does minimal damage; its utility is in tethering.
* **`consumable_item_id`:** The item ID that is consumed from the `Inventory System` on use (e.g., for the Seismic Launcher).
* **`slot_type`:** Defines which hull hardpoints can mount this tool, aligning with the "Slots" defined in `7.3-GDD-Assets-Ship-Chassis.md`.

## 4. Part 3: Analogue TTRPG Implementation (For Asset Sheets)

For the TTRPG, tools grant new `Action Check` options or provide modifiers to existing ones.

### Analogue Asset Stats

| Asset Type | Asset Difficulty (Skill) | `WP` Cost (Est.) | Special Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rotary Drill | **+2** (Tech/Pilot) | Medium | Grants the **"Breach Hull"** `Action Check` in close-quarters. On a `Success` (10+), deals direct Hull damage. |
| Reinforced Prow | **+1** (Piloting) | Low | Grants the **"Bulldoze / Pin"** `Act Risky` option. On a `Success` (10+), deals damage and pins the target; on a `Failure` (<10), you also take damage or lose position. |
| Ablative Laser | **+1** (Tech) | High | Requires 1 `Power Slot`. Can be used to `Act Cautiously` to add a **"Ship Quirk"** to a target instead of dealing damage. |
| Seismic Charge Launcher | **+1** (Tech) | Low (Consumable) | Firing consumes `1 WP` (or a "Seismic Charge" item). Has a high chance to add a **"Ship Quirk"**. |
| Harpoon & Winch | **+1** (Piloting) | Medium | Grants the **"Grapple Target"** `Action Check`. On a `Success` (10+), the target cannot flee. A key tool for "Tower" hulls. |
| Debris Scoop | **0** (Standard) | Medium | Requires a "Catamaran" hull. Grants a `+2` `Module Modifier` to all salvage-related `Action Checks` (e.g., "Claim Wreckage"). |

### Analogue Rules

* **Asset Difficulty:** This modifier applies to any `Action Check` made *using* that specific tool (e.g., a "Piloting" check to pin, a "Tech" check to operate the laser).
* **Special Rule:** Defines the tool's unique mechanical function within the TTRPG's abstract systems.
