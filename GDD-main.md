## 0. Introduction

* **Game Title:** GDTLancer (Working Title, Acronym: **Generative Dynamic Transmedia** Lancer)
* **Logline:** A multi-platform space adventure RPG blending sandbox simulation with TTRPG-inspired emergent narrative, set in a distinct stylized sci-fi universe where player and AI actions shape a living world.
* **Genre:** 3D Space Adventure, RPG, Sandbox, Simulation, TTRPG-Hybrid.
* **Theme:** Guided fiction-first exploration, emergent narrative, story-driven world simulation, hard sci-fi aesthetics with touches of space fantasy. *(Setting details like specific 'futurism' to be defined separately from visual style).*
* **Target Audience:** Fans of Sci-Fi, Space Sims (Elite, Freelancer), Sandbox RPGs (Mount & Blade), Narrative Games, and emergent world simulations (Dwarf Fortress, EVE Online). Also, TTRPG enthusiasts (Stars Without Number, Ironsworn/Starforged).
* **Platforms:**
    * **Primary Digital:** Godot 4 (Full-featured PC/Mobile target). Visuals prioritize clarity, performance, and a distinct stylized look `[See Section 8]`.
    * **Secondary Digital (Optional/Exploratory):** Godot 3 (Lower spec), J2ME (Simplified, potentially turn-based version focusing on core loops - acts as design constraint/testbed). Features minimalist wireframe visuals `[See Section 8]`.
    * **Analogue:** Standalone TTRPG ruleset mirroring core concepts.
* **Unique Selling Points:**
    * Deep emergent narrative driven by unified player/AI mechanics.
    * Living world simulation shaped by agent actions.
    * **Transmedia** approach enabling varied experiences (full 3D, minimalist mobile, TTRPG) within the same core design.
    * Distinct **Neo-Retro 3D Visual Style** `[See Section 8, 1. Glossary]` and accessible gameplay.
    * Investigable world history via the **Galactic Record** (or similar) `[See Section 1. Glossary, 6.3]`.

## 1. Glossary

* **Action Check:** The core dice roll resolution mechanic (3d6 + Mod ≥ Thresholds). `[See Section 4.1]`
* **Agent:** Any active entity in the world capable of pursuing goals (Player or NPC). `[See Section 6.1]`
* **Analogue Version:** The parallel tabletop roleplaying game ruleset. `[See Section 10.3]`
* **Chronicle:** An in-game interface for viewing significant historical events generated by Agent actions. `[See Section 6.3]`
* **Event System (Oracle Lite):** The system generating unexpected narrative events and complications. `[See Section 5.2]`
* **Focus:** The primary meta-resource used by Agents to influence Action Checks or gain temporary advantages. `[See Section 4.2]`
* **Gameplay Module:** A distinct set of gameplay mechanics or "mini-game" loop within the overall gameplay (e.g., Combat, Mining, Travel). `[See Section 3]`
* **Goal System (Vows Lite):** The system for tracking Agent objectives and their progress. `[See Section 5.1]`
* **Neo-Retro 3D:** The chosen term for the primary visual style, characterized by minimalist, hard-edged 3D models, clean geometric shapes, solid color materials, potentially using techniques like dithering or posterized lighting, inspired by earlier generations of 3D graphics but rendered with modern clarity. Distinct from the ultra-minimalist wireframe style of the J2ME version. `[See Section 8]`
* **Phase:** A distinct stage in the development plan focusing on specific systems. `[See Section 7]`
* **Progress Track:** A visual representation of progress towards completing a Goal. `[See Section 5.1]`
* **Trigger Action:** A specific high-stakes action requiring an Action Check for resolution. `[See Section 4.3]`
* **World State:** The collection of data representing the current status of factions, economies, discoveries, etc., in the game world. `[See Section 6.2]`

## 2. Game Pillars & Vision

* **Living World:** The universe persists and evolves independently of the player. NPC agents pursue goals, factions shift power, discoveries are made, and history unfolds based on systemic interactions. The world state is dynamic and reactive. `[See Section 6]`
* **Emergent Narrative:** Stories arise naturally from the interplay of game systems, player choices, AI actions, and random events, rather than relying solely on pre-scripted plots. Player goals interact with world events and NPC agendas. `[See Section 5, 6]`
* **Meaningful Progression:** Player advancement is tied not just to simulation skill (combat, trading) but significantly to achieving narrative goals, overcoming challenges via core mechanics, and impacting the world state. `[See Section 5.3]`
* **Unified & Accessible Mechanics:** Core gameplay mechanics are applied consistently to both player and AI agents, creating parity. Systems are designed to be "easy to learn, hard to master," favoring depth from interaction over complex individual rules. `[See Section 4, 6.1]`
* **Guided Fiction-First:** While sandbox elements are strong, mechanics encourage players to think in terms of character actions and narrative intent, which then trigger relevant systems (inspired by TTRPG principles). `[See Section 4.3]`

## 3. Core Gameplay Loop & Modules

* **Gameplay Structure:** The overall gameplay is divided into distinct **Gameplay Modules** – self-contained "mini-games" representing specific activities.
* **Module Characteristics:**
    * Clear entry and exit points in game logic (e.g., entering combat, docking at a station, starting a mining operation).
    * Focus on a specific activity (e.g., Piloting/Travel, Combat, Mining, Trading, Negotiation, Investigation, Repair).
    * Utilize specific resources (e.g., fuel, ammo, cargo space) and shared resources (like Focus `[See Section 4.2]`).
    * Resolved through direct player simulation or potentially abstracted via Narrative Rolls (`[See Section 4.4]`, applicable mainly in Phase 2+).
    * Clear UI indication of the active module and relevant controls/information.
* **Core Loop:** Engage in Gameplay Modules -> Resolve Trigger Actions via Core Mechanics -> Gain/Lose Resources (incl. Focus) -> Gather Statistics -> Potentially Progress Narrative Goals -> Choose Next Module/Action.

## 4. Core Mechanics (Phase 1 Foundation)

This phase establishes *how* actions with uncertain outcomes are resolved.

* **4.1. Action Check (Dice Mechanic):**
    * **System:** 3d6 + Modifier ≥ Thresholds (Roll-Over).
    * **Dice:** Standard 3d6 roll.
    * **Modifier:** Relevant Agent Stat/Skill (typically +0 to +3 range initially).
    * **Thresholds (Standard Difficulty - Subject to Tuning):**
        * **Failure:** Roll Total < 10.
        * **Success with Complication:** Roll Total 10-13.
        * **Critical Success:** Roll Total ≥ 14.
    * **Application:** Used for resolving Trigger Actions `[See Section 4.3]`.
* **4.2. Focus (Meta-Resource):**
    * **Concept:** Represents an agent's luck, preparedness, or determination. A spendable resource providing agency over uncertainty.
    * **Gain:** +1 Focus upon achieving a Critical Success (≥ 14) on an Action Check `[4.1]`.
    * **Loss:** Reset Focus to 0 upon achieving Failure (< 10) on an Action Check `[4.1]`. *(Initial design, may change to losing points)*.
    * **Cap:** Low initial cap (e.g., 3 or 4).
    * **Spending:** Spending Focus is always the player's choice, available when conditions are met. Initial options:
        * **Narrative Boost (Instant):** Spend 1 Focus *before* an Action Check `[4.1]` to add +3 to the roll total.
        * **Simulation Boost (Persistent):** Spend 1 Focus upon *entering* a specific Gameplay Module `[3]` to gain a passive benefit for its duration (e.g., +10% Mining Yield until cargo full, +5% Combat Damage until combat ends). Requires clear UI indicator.
* **4.3. Trigger Actions:**
    * **Concept:** Specific, high-stakes moments or risky maneuvers within gameplay where the outcome is uncertain and narratively significant, prompting an Action Check `[4.1]`. Distinct from routine simulation actions.
    * **Examples:** Evasive Maneuver under fire, critical System Override attempt, key Persuasion dialogue choice.
    * **UI Indication:** The game should provide clear prompts or hints when a Trigger Action is being attempted and an Action Check is required.
* **4.4. Simulation vs. Narrative Resolution:**
    * **Phase 1 Model (Strict Separation):** Standard actions within Gameplay Modules `[3]` are resolved via direct player skill and simulation physics/logic. Action Checks `[4.1]` resolve only the defined Trigger Actions `[4.3]`.
    * **Phase 2+ Model (Optional Abstraction):** For certain modules (e.g., Travel, potentially routine Combat/Mining), players may gain the *option* to resolve the entire module via an abstract Narrative Roll instead of simulation. This requires careful balancing of risk, reward, and resource cost. `[See Section 10.3 for Analogue relevance]`

## 5. Narrative Systems (Phase 2 Foundation)

This phase establishes *why* agents act and how the narrative progresses. Builds upon Core Mechanics `[4]`.

* **5.1. Goal System ("Vows Lite"):**
    * **Concept:** System for agents (initially player) to have active objectives driving their actions (akin to *Starforged* Vows).
    * **Implementation:** Mission Log / Captain's Log tracking active goals. Goals can be assigned, discovered, or potentially player-defined via templates.
    * **Progress Tracks:** Major goals have associated tracks (e.g., 6-10 segments) measuring progress.
    * **Marking Progress:** Achieved through successful actions relevant to the goal (often tied to specific Action Check `[4.1]` successes or reaching simulation milestones).
    * **Completion:** Resolved via a final check or upon filling the track, granting Narrative Rewards `[5.3]`.
* **5.2. Event System ("Oracle Lite"):**
    * **Concept:** Generates unexpected events, complications, and opportunities, driving emergent narrative (akin to *Starforged* Oracles).
    * **Triggers:** Can occur reactively (e.g., as a consequence of Failure on an Action Check `[4.1]`) or proactively (e.g., player uses "Scan for Anomalies", during Abstracted Travel `[4.4]`).
    * **Implementation:** Context-aware random tables or procedural generators based on location, situation (combat, travel, exploration), and potentially active Goals `[5.1]`.
    * **Outcomes:** Introduce new threats, obstacles, discoveries, dilemmas, or plot hooks.
* **5.3. Narrative Rewards & Progression:**
    * **Concept:** Rewarding players specifically for engaging with and advancing the narrative elements.
    * **Implementation:** Experience Points (XP) or similar metric awarded for:
        * Completing Goals `[5.1]` (scaled by difficulty/length).
        * Reaching significant Goal milestones.
        * Overcoming significant challenges presented by the Event System `[5.2]`.
        * *(Later)* Positive interactions with NPCs/Factions.
    * **Progression Uses:** Spending XP to improve stats/modifiers (impacting `[4.1]`), unlock passive perks ("Assets Lite"), or potentially increase Focus Cap `[4.2]`.
    * **Statistics:** Gather statistics from Gameplay Module `[3]` completion (e.g., minerals mined, pirates defeated, trade profit) to feed into long-term progression, reputation, or potentially trigger Events `[5.2]`.

## 6. World & Agency (Phase 3+ Foundation)

This phase focuses on bringing the world to life through NPC actions and persistent change. Builds upon Core Mechanics `[4]` and Narrative Systems `[5]`.

* **6.1. NPC/Agent Simulation:**
    * **Goal:** Non-player agents (NPCs, Factions) utilize the same Core Mechanics `[4]` and Narrative Systems `[5]` as the player.
    * **Implementation:** NPCs have stats, pursue procedurally generated or assigned Goals `[5.1]`, make Action Checks `[4.1]`, are affected by Events `[5.2]`, potentially use a simplified Focus `[4.2]`. Simulation fidelity depends on relevance/distance to player `[See Section 10.2]`.
* **6.2. World State Evolution:**
    * **Concept:** The actions and outcomes of *all* agents (player and NPC `[6.1]`) modify a persistent world state.
    * **Examples:** Faction territory control, economic conditions, discovery of new locations/resources, sector danger levels, political climate.
    * **Visibility:** Changes are reflected in the environment, news feeds, rumors, mission availability, market prices.
* **6.3. Chronicle:**
    * **Concept:** An in-game system allowing players to view significant historical events generated by player and NPC `[6.1]` actions and world state `[6.2]` changes. Provides context, lore, and potentially gameplay leads.
* **6.4. Legacy & Time:**
    * **Concept (Long-Term):** Potential for major time skips, agent retirement, inheritance, generational play impacting the ongoing world simulation.

## 7. Phased Development Plan

A summary of the development focus for each phase:

* **Phase 1:** Implement Core Gameplay Modules `[3]` and Core Mechanics `[4]`. Establish the fundamental action resolution loop, Focus resource mechanics, and basic simulation/narrative separation. *Goal: Testable core gameplay feel, value of Focus.*
* **Phase 2:** Implement Narrative Systems `[5]`. Introduce Goals, Events, and Narrative Rewards/Progression. *Goal: Provide purpose, dynamic situations, and incentivize narrative engagement.*
* **Phase 3:** Begin implementing World & Agency `[6]`. Start basic NPC simulation `[6.1]` using core systems, rudimentary world state changes `[6.2]`, and basic player visibility (news/rumors). Develop Analogue "World Tick" `[10.3]`. *Goal: Demonstrate a minimally dynamic world.*
* **Later Phases:** Scale up NPC simulation `[6.1]`, deepen world state interactions `[6.2]`, build Chronicle `[6.3]`, implement optional abstraction `[4.4]`, add deeper content (NPCs, factions, story arcs), potentially explore Legacy `[6.4]`.

## 8. Art & Audio Direction

* **8.1. Primary Visual Style (Godot 4): "Neo-Retro 3D"** `[See Glossary]`
    * Utilizes minimalist 3D models with hard edges and clean geometric forms.
    * Emphasizes solid color materials, potentially combined with dithered or posterized lighting/shading for a distinct, stylized, non-photorealistic look.
    * Prioritizes clarity, performance, and strong composition over high polygon counts or complex textures.
    * Function-driven designs for ships and stations, fitting a hard sci-fi aesthetic.
* **8.2. Secondary Visual Style (J2ME): "Minimalist Wireframe"**
    * Employs low-detail, vector-like wireframe 3D models (inspired by the classic *Elite*).
    * Uses color gradients or simple color coding to represent depth or object type.
    * Designed for extreme performance limitations, potentially supporting turn-based gameplay.
* **8.3. Environment Design:**
    * Visually interesting space environments (stylized nebulae, asteroid fields, unique stellar phenomena) to avoid empty black void. Scale adjusted for gameplay.
    * Focus on strong lighting, composition, and atmosphere across all platform styles.
* **8.4. Audio:**
    * Functional and minimalist sound design reinforcing the neo-retro theme. Clear feedback for gameplay actions and UI interactions.
    * Atmospheric music, potentially generative or thematic based on location, Gameplay Module `[3]`, or situation intensity.

## 9. UI/UX Principles

* **Minimalism:** Clean, non-intrusive interface. Information presented clearly when needed, avoiding screen clutter.
* **Clarity:** Player should always intuitively understand the current Gameplay Module `[3]`, available simulation actions, Focus status `[4.2]`, and the context/options for any Action Checks `[4.3]` or Events `[5.2]`.
* **Accessibility:** Target an "easy to learn, hard to master" curve. Provide clear tutorials or integrated contextual help. Consider options for color blindness, text scaling, and potentially adjustable UI elements.
* **Dynamic Camera:** Utilize camera work effectively in the 3D versions, especially during potentially static moments like decision prompts or dice roll resolutions, to maintain visual interest and provide cinematic flair where appropriate (without being jarring).

## 10. Technical Considerations

* **10.1. Engine:** Godot 4 (Primary), potential exploration with Godot 3 / J2ME for core loop testing/simplification.
* **10.2. Optimization:** High priority across all platforms, especially for the primary digital version targeting PC/Mobile. Crucial for NPC/Agent Simulation `[6.1]` and World State `[6.2]` management (requires robust abstraction/LOD systems for off-screen/less important agents).
* **10.3. Analogue Version:** Ruleset designed in parallel, likely simplifying or abstracting certain Gameplay Modules `[3]`. Relies heavily on Action Checks `[4.1]` and Narrative Systems `[5]`. Requires a "World Event Tick" mechanic to simulate the dynamic world evolution `[6]` abstractly between sessions or during downtime.
* **10.4. Modularity:** Design systems (Gameplay Modules `[3]`, Core Mechanics `[4]`, Narrative Systems `[5]`, World/Agency `[6]`) with clear interfaces and minimal hard dependencies to facilitate phased development `[7]`, testing, iteration, and adaptation across different platforms (Transmedia goal).
